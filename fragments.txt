The second crucial time point is after 6 months of therapy, when the BCR-ABL IS transcript levels are expected to be <1% (2-log reduction). This time point helps identify a higher-risk subgroup of patients who failed to achieve EMR at 3 months after imatinib treatment. For example, group 2, who achieved BCR-ABL IS transcripts <1% IS at 6 months after failing to achieve an EMR at 3 months, did well in the absence of a significant difference in the short- or long-term outcomes compared with group 1, who achieved an EMR at 3 months.

EC50, 50% effective concentration; ID50, 50% inhibitory dilution; TKI, tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The median (IQR) EC 50 value for anti‐S IgG in all patients from ELISA testing was 100 5 (25–408·3). Amongst different TKIs the median EC 50 values were 251 5 for imatinib, 100·5 for nilotinib, 373·5 for dasatinib, 379·5 for bosutinib and 25 for ponatinib. No patients had evidence of confirmed previous infection as determined by a >fourfold increase in OD of IgG against the Nucleocapsid (N) and S protein in the pre‐vaccine sample. 4 However, a single patient did have a
96-well culture dishes by flow cytometry, and cultures were expanded in the same medium. For transplantation of irradiated recipients, donor bone marrow cells were transduced for 3 h in the absence of cytokine support with a vector encoding p185, and infected cells (1 × 10 6 per recipient mouse) were infused without intervening culture into lethally irradiated (11 Gy in two fractions) animals. To quantify cytostatic effects of imatinib, cells plated at 2 × 10 4 per well in 96-well plates were cultured in the presence or absence of 10 ng/mL recombinant IL-7 (R&D Systems), and imatinib (Novartis) was added to achieve the indicated concentrations. Cell growth was quantified 72 h later by a methane–thiosulfonate–base assay (CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution reagent, Promega).

reorganization essential for multiple cellular processes, such as cell migration ( 1 , 25 – 27 ), proliferation ( 1 , 28 , 29 ), cytokinesis ( 30 ), smooth muscle contraction ( 9 , 31 , 32 ), and cancer metastasis ( 26 ). c-Abl expression is upregulated in asthmatic human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) ( 31 , 33 ). Inhibition of c-Abl by the inhibitor, imatinib, reduces airway hyperresponsiveness and remodeling in animal models of asthma ( 34 ), and relieves breathing difficulty of patients with severe asthma ( 4 , 35 ). In smooth muscle cells, c-Abl orchestrates actin reorganization by controlling glia maturation factor (GMF)-γ ( 36 ), which is a member of the
imbalance favoring local production and signaling activity in pulmonary vascular cells ( 10 ). Over the last decades, substantial evidence has accumulated in favor of this idea as seen in preclinical studies that support the contribution of seminal growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), to smooth muscle hyperplasia in PAH vasculopathy ( 11 ). Efforts to target PDGF in PAH have been undertaken most recently with imatinib, an FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor known to target the PDGF receptor and with documented efficacy in animal models of PAH. Unfortunately, a phase 3 clinical trial (IMPRES) demonstrated modest improvement in clinical parameters and increased rates of intracranial bleeding that have mitigated the early enthusiasm for use of imatinib in patients with PAH ( 12 ). Despite these unexpected results, there is still interest in identifying other candidate growth factors as treatment targets because existing PAH therapies fail to prevent disease progression, possibly by their inability to effectively halt progressive vascular remodeling. As the first among equals, NGF is
effects in the proliferation and migration of SMCs are better described in the systemic circulation where it is regarded as an important contributor to major vascular conditions such as atherosclerosis ( 20 ). Our present study focused on PASMCs and human idiopathic PAH, to better analyze the role of PDGF in humans, as well as the possible interest of novel therapeutic agents targeting the PDGF pathway, such as imatinib in PAH. Proliferation and migration of PASMCs represent a singular step in the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular remodeling. Many studies have addressed the phenotypes of the cells involved in neointima formation. Early findings suggested that endothelial cells were the predominant phenotype in plexiform lesions ( 21 ), but more recently
potent mitogens and chemoattractants for SMCs, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, usually forming homo- or heterodimers that stimulate cell surface receptors, which in turn activate the major signal transduction pathways, such as the Ras-mitogen activated protein kinase pathway. The cellular response to stimulation by growth factors involves proliferation, migration, and resistance to apoptosis. Several case reports suggested that in end-stage pulmonary hypertensive patients, compassionate treatment with the PDGF inhibitor imatinib could restore and/or improve clinical conditions ( 43 – 45 ). The phase III randomized controlled trial Imatinib in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (IMPRES, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00902174 ) is currently underway. Serotonin (5-HT) and RhoA are mediators investigated now for many years in the context of vascular proliferation in pulmonary hypertension. Guilluy and colleagues in this journal described an intriguing cross-link between both signaling pathways ( 46 ). In
of SCF would be multifactorial by inhibiting not only the local mast cell populations involved early on during the response but also the recruitment and activation of eosinophils ( 22 , 23 , 43 – 45 ). Furthermore, the recent identification of increased expression of both SCF and c-kit in airways of individuals with asthma gives additional support for targeting this activation pathway ( 28 ). However, because imatinib may also have effects on other receptor tyrosine kinase family members, such as PDGFR, the effects observed in this study likely were an outcome of blocking other pathways as well. The responses are also likely to encompass the alteration of bone marrow-derived cells, especially if imatinib is given long term. We found no alteration of circulating leukocyte numbers (data not shown), but have not performed extensive studies to examine bone marrow or peripheral leukocyte counts in the present studies. However, in these studies imatinib was given a single time just before allergen challenge, and the effects may be centered on the alleviation of the inflammatory responses directly activated within the airways. The reduction of chemokines may have resulted from decreased Th2 cytokines as well as the direct effects of blocking specific signaling processes related to specific receptor tyrosine kinase pathways. Previous observations in patients treated with imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia have identified increases in IFN after a 3-month treatment protocol, potentially suggesting an alteration of the overall balance of Th1 and Th2 type responses ( 46 ). In contrast, another study that examined T cell responses in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia before and after imatinib treatment found no difference in the Th1/Th2 cytokine levels on polyclonal activation ( 47 ). Interestingly, data suggest that imatinib may produce long-term, event-free survival in patients with T cell lymphoid blastic phase ( 48 ). Another recent publication has indicated that imatinib treatment affects the development of CD34+ progenitor cells into dendritic cells ( 49 ), further supporting a role for imatinib in altering the development of detrimental immune responses. Related to the current study are previous observations where SCF has been specifically blocked in the airway, either by antibody or antisense therapy, and an alteration in Th2 cytokines observed ( 31 , 32 ). Thus, by blocking the initiation of this

Presentation includes shortness of breath, haemoptysis, recurrent symptoms suggestive of pneumonia, and progression to right-sided heart failure. Transcatheter balloon angioplasty and stent placement is the mainstay treatment, though with high recurrence rates. 4 , 5 Antiproliferative agents such as imatinib and bevacizumab are under investigation. The advent of new treatment modalities for atrial fibrillation has led to an increase in the incidence of acquired PVS. 3 , 6 A multi-centre trial conducted at 13 sites found mild or moderate PV stenosis in 8.2% of ablated PVs at 3 months post-procedure,
with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, demonstrating higher mortality compared to the non‐MPN population. Worse outcome was associated with older age, male sex, comorbidities, a diagnosis of MF, lymphopenia and respiratory support requirement. Higher risks were also identified for ruxolitinib discontinuation following infection. The CANDID CML study reported on 110 patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, 70% of whom were on TKIs. 3 Univariate analysis revealed age >75 years, severe infection and use of imatinib (likely surrogate marker of older age) as adverse risk factors. We appreciate that the present study is exploratory in nature, with a limited cohort size and comprises a range of chronic MPN conditions. We focussed solely on T‐cell functionality, did not include measurement of SARS‐CoV‐2‐neutralising antibodies or assessment for pre‐existing

This study examined the possible enhancing effect of vitamin D on the efficacy of drugs used for the treatment of PNF in vitro. Paired Schwann cells and fibroblasts were cultured from 10 PNFs and treated with imatinib and nilotinib in the absence and presence of calcipotriol, an analogue of the active metabolite of vitamin D. IC 50 values for cell proliferation were calculated. Calcipotriol reduced the IC 50 of the two drugs in both tumorous Schwann cells and non-tumorous fibroblasts by 40 to 45%. Calcipotriol enhanced the efficacy of imatinib and nilotinib on PNF-derived cells in vitro, though rather non-specifically. Nevertheless, sustaining vitamin D at 100-200 nM, the physiological range, may be beneficial for reducing the dose of drugs without scarifying efficacy. \n
