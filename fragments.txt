The second crucial time point is after 6 months of therapy, when the BCR-ABL IS transcript levels are expected to be <1% (2-log reduction). This time point helps identify a higher-risk subgroup of patients who failed to achieve EMR at 3 months after imatinib treatment. For example, group 2, who achieved BCR-ABL IS transcripts <1% IS at 6 months after failing to achieve an EMR at 3 months, did well in the absence of a significant difference in the short- or long-term outcomes compared with group 1, who achieved an EMR at 3 months.

For transplantation of irradiated recipients, donor bone marrow cells were transduced for 3 h in the absence of cytokine support with a vector encoding p185, and infected cells (1 × 10 6 per recipient mouse) were infused without intervening culture into lethally irradiated (11 Gy in two fractions) animals. To quantify cytostatic effects of imatinib, cells plated at 2 × 10 4 per well in 96-well plates were cultured in the presence or absence of 10 ng/mL recombinant IL-7 (R&D Systems), and imatinib (Novartis) was added to achieve the indicated concentrations. Cell growth was quantified 72 h later by a methane–thiosulfonate–base assay (CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution reagent, Promega).

reorganization essential for multiple cellular processes, such as cell migration ( 1 , 25 – 27 ), proliferation ( 1 , 28 , 29 ), cytokinesis ( 30 ), smooth muscle contraction ( 9 , 31 , 32 ), and cancer metastasis ( 26 ). c-Abl expression is upregulated in asthmatic human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) ( 31 , 33 ). Inhibition of c-Abl by the inhibitor, imatinib, reduces airway hyperresponsiveness and remodeling in animal models of asthma ( 34 ), and relieves breathing difficulty of patients with severe asthma ( 4 , 35 ). In smooth muscle cells, c-Abl orchestrates actin reorganization by controlling glia maturation factor (GMF)-γ ( 36 ), which is a member of the
imbalance favoring local production and signaling activity in pulmonary vascular cells ( 10 ). Over the last decades, substantial evidence has accumulated in favor of this idea as seen in preclinical studies that support the contribution of seminal growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), to smooth muscle hyperplasia in PAH vasculopathy ( 11 ). Efforts to target PDGF in PAH have been undertaken most recently with imatinib, an FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor known to target the PDGF receptor and with documented efficacy in animal models of PAH. Unfortunately, a phase 3 clinical trial (IMPRES) demonstrated modest improvement in clinical parameters and increased rates of intracranial bleeding that have mitigated the early enthusiasm for use of imatinib in patients with PAH ( 12 ). Despite these unexpected results, there is still interest in identifying other candidate growth factors as treatment targets because existing PAH therapies fail to prevent disease progression, possibly by their inability to effectively halt progressive vascular remodeling. As the first among equals, NGF is
effects in the proliferation and migration of SMCs are better described in the systemic circulation where it is regarded as an important contributor to major vascular conditions such as atherosclerosis ( 20 ). Our present study focused on PASMCs and human idiopathic PAH, to better analyze the role of PDGF in humans, as well as the possible interest of novel therapeutic agents targeting the PDGF pathway, such as imatinib in PAH. Proliferation and migration of PASMCs represent a singular step in the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular remodeling. Many studies have addressed the phenotypes of the cells involved in neointima formation. Early findings suggested that endothelial cells were the predominant phenotype in plexiform lesions ( 21 ), but more recently
potent mitogens and chemoattractants for SMCs, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, usually forming homo- or heterodimers that stimulate cell surface receptors, which in turn activate the major signal transduction pathways, such as the Ras-mitogen activated protein kinase pathway. The cellular response to stimulation by growth factors involves proliferation, migration, and resistance to apoptosis. Several case reports suggested that in end-stage pulmonary hypertensive patients, compassionate treatment with the PDGF inhibitor imatinib could restore and/or improve clinical conditions ( 43 – 45 ). The phase III randomized controlled trial Imatinib in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (IMPRES, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00902174 ) is currently underway. Serotonin (5-HT) and RhoA are mediators investigated now for many years in the context of vascular proliferation in pulmonary hypertension. Guilluy and colleagues in this journal described an intriguing cross-link between both signaling pathways ( 46 ). In
of SCF would be multifactorial by inhibiting not only the local mast cell populations involved early on during the response but also the recruitment and activation of eosinophils ( 22 , 23 , 43 – 45 ). Furthermore, the recent identification of increased expression of both SCF and c-kit in airways of individuals with asthma gives additional support for targeting this activation pathway ( 28 ). However, because imatinib may also have effects on other receptor tyrosine kinase family members, such as PDGFR, the effects observed in this study likely were an outcome of blocking other pathways as well. The responses are also likely to encompass the alteration of bone marrow-derived cells, especially if imatinib is given long term. We found no alteration of circulating leukocyte numbers (data not shown), but have not performed extensive studies to examine bone marrow or peripheral leukocyte counts in the present studies. However, in these studies imatinib was given a single time just before allergen challenge, and the effects may be centered on the alleviation of the inflammatory responses directly activated within the airways. The reduction of chemokines may have resulted from decreased Th2 cytokines as well as the direct effects of blocking specific signaling processes related to specific receptor tyrosine kinase pathways. Previous observations in patients treated with imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia have identified increases in IFN after a 3-month treatment protocol, potentially suggesting an alteration of the overall balance of Th1 and Th2 type responses ( 46 ). In contrast, another study that examined T cell responses in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia before and after imatinib treatment found no difference in the Th1/Th2 cytokine levels on polyclonal activation ( 47 ). Interestingly, data suggest that imatinib may produce long-term, event-free survival in patients with T cell lymphoid blastic phase ( 48 ). Another recent publication has indicated that imatinib treatment affects the development of CD34+ progenitor cells into dendritic cells ( 49 ), further supporting a role for imatinib in altering the development of detrimental immune responses. Related to the current study are previous observations where SCF has been specifically blocked in the airway, either by antibody or antisense therapy, and an alteration in Th2 cytokines observed ( 31 , 32 ). Thus, by blocking the initiation of this

Presentation includes shortness of breath, haemoptysis, recurrent symptoms suggestive of pneumonia, and progression to right-sided heart failure. Transcatheter balloon angioplasty and stent placement is the mainstay treatment, though with high recurrence rates. 4 , 5 Antiproliferative agents such as imatinib and bevacizumab are under investigation. The advent of new treatment modalities for atrial fibrillation has led to an increase in the incidence of acquired PVS. 3 , 6 A multi-centre trial conducted at 13 sites found mild or moderate PV stenosis in 8.2% of ablated PVs at 3 months post-procedure,
with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, demonstrating higher mortality compared to the non‐MPN population. Worse outcome was associated with older age, male sex, comorbidities, a diagnosis of MF, lymphopenia and respiratory support requirement. Higher risks were also identified for ruxolitinib discontinuation following infection. The CANDID CML study reported on 110 patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, 70% of whom were on TKIs. 3 Univariate analysis revealed age >75 years, severe infection and use of imatinib (likely surrogate marker of older age) as adverse risk factors. We appreciate that the present study is exploratory in nature, with a limited cohort size and comprises a range of chronic MPN conditions.

This study examined the possible enhancing effect of vitamin D on the efficacy of drugs used for the treatment of PNF in vitro. Paired Schwann cells and fibroblasts were cultured from 10 PNFs and treated with imatinib and nilotinib in the absence and presence of calcipotriol, an analogue of the active metabolite of vitamin D. IC 50 values for cell proliferation were calculated. Calcipotriol reduced the IC 50 of the two drugs in both tumorous Schwann cells and non-tumorous fibroblasts by 40 to 45%. Calcipotriol enhanced the efficacy of imatinib and nilotinib on PNF-derived cells in vitro, though rather non-specifically. Nevertheless, sustaining vitamin D at 100-200 nM, the physiological range, may be beneficial for reducing the dose of drugs without scarifying efficacy. \n

kinase BcrAbl (the product of bcrabl gene and the Philadelphia Chromosome) is causally associated with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia and Acute lymphocytic leukemia. Constitutive tyrosine kinase activity of BcrAbl promotes proliferation and survival of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells. Inhibition of BcrAbl tyrosine kinase activity or signaling proteins activated by BcrAbl in CML cells blocks proliferation and causes apoptotic cell death. The selective Abl kinase inhibitor, STI-571 (marketed as Gleevec), is toxic to CML cells in culture, causes regression of CML tumors in nude mice, and is currently used to treat CML patients. Expression of BcrAbl in hematopoietic stem cells promotes transformation and acts early in leukemogenesis. Inhibition of this kinase with STI-571 effectively controls CML in the chronic phase

Overall, NVA237 was well tolerated by patients, with the number of adverse events similar to or lower than placebo. These results will form the basis of regulatory filings planned for later this year. A Phase III study showed a significant survival benefit for patients with resected KIT+ gastrointestinal stromal tumors who received adjuvant Glivec (imatinib) treatment for three years following surgery as compared to one year following surgery. The results, gathered five years after surgery, showed that 66% of patients taking adjuvant Glivec therapy for three years remained free of cancer recurrence (primary endpoint) compared to 48% of those who had received adjuvant Glivec therapy for only one year (p<.0001). Moreover, 92% of patients taking Glivec for three years had survived to the five-year mark (secondary endpoint), compared to 82% of those who had received Glivec for only one year (p=.019). These clinical data will be submitted to regulatory authorities in the second half of 2011 to support extended adjuvant Glivec treatment of three years.

collaboration with molecular diagnostics company Cepheid to develop a new FDA cleared/approved Bcr-Abl test, which adheres to the International Scale. The goal of the collaboration is to help doctors more reliably monitor Ph+ CML patients. Cepheid and Novartis also will develop a next generation test, which is expected to enable even more sensitive testing, indicating the depth of a patient's response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including Tasigna and Glivec. Currently there are no FDA cleared/approved tests to monitor for Bcr-Abl. "The creation and introduction of Glivec revolutionized the treatment of Ph+ CML by substantially improving overall survival rates for patients," said Hervé Hoppenot, President, Novartis Oncology. "We are encouraged by the ongoing clinical development of Tasigna as a new treatment showing that at 24 months it continues to surpass Glivec in slowing disease progression in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase Ph+ CML." Another study will be presented at this year's annual ASH meeting which provides further support for the use of Tasigna in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML.

74%[2] and 45%[1] of patients treated with Tasigna exhibited MMR after six months. Tasigna was well tolerated in both studies. "Newly diagnosed patients taking Tasigna experienced remarkable responses with minimal toxicity," said Jorge Cortes, MD, Professor of Medicine and Deputy Chair of Leukemia at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. "These results indicate there is potential for patients to reach important clinical milestones faster." Glivec[*](imatinib) is the standard treatment for Ph+ CML and rapidly transformed the treatment of CML when it was introduced in 2001. An ongoing Phase III trial called ENESTnd (Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy in Clinical Trials of Newly Diagnosed Ph+ CML Patients) is evaluating Tasigna vs. Glivec in newly diagnosed patients and is now fully accrued. Data from ENESTnd will be reported once available. "Building on the wealth of scientific and clinical knowledge we have gained with Glivec, Novartis strives to continually uncover novel approaches to help Ph+ CML patients achieve the best long-term outcomes," said David Epstein, President and CEO, Novartis Oncology. Tasigna is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of patients who are resistant or intolerant to prior treatment including Glivec. Tasigna is specifically designed to target the Bcr-Abl protein, which is produced only by cells containing the abnormal Philadelphia chromosome, and is recognized as the key cause of the overproduction of cancerous white blood cells. The Philadelphia chromosome is found in nearly all patients with CML. Study results The first
or clinically significant bradycardia), as well as in patients who have or may develop prolongation of QTc. These include patients with abnormally low potassium or magnesium levels, patients with congenital long QT syndrome, patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicines or other drugs that may lead to QT prolongation. Low levels of potassium or magnesium must be corrected prior to Tasigna administration. Studies have also shown virtually no non-hematologic cross-intolerance between Glivec and Tasigna. (Cross-intolerance occurs when patients cannot tolerate two different drugs because of the same side effects). Causes of non-hematologic intolerance to Glivec included Grade 3 or 4 rash/skin toxicity, fluid retention, gastrointestinal intolerance, liver toxicity, and myalgia/arthralgia. About Glivec Glivec is approved in more than 90 countries including the US, EU and Japan for the treatment of all phases of Ph+ CML. Glivec is also approved in the EU, US and other countries for the treatment of patients with Kit (CD117)-positive gastrointestinal tumors (GIST), which cannot be surgically removed and/or have already spread to other parts of the body (metastasized). In Japan, Glivec is approved for the treatment of patients with Kit (CD117)-positive GIST. In the EU, Glivec is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) in combination with chemotherapy and as a single agent for patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL. Glivec is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable, recurrent and/or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) who are not eligible for surgery. Glivec is also approved for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD). Glivec is also approved for hypereosinophilic syndrome and/or chronic eosinophilic leukemia (HES/CEL). The effectiveness of Glivec is based on overall hematologic and cytogenetic response rates and progression-free survival in CML, on hematological and cytogenetic response rates in Ph+ ALL, and on objective response rates in GIST and DFSP. There are no controlled trials demonstrating increased survival. Not all indications are available in every country. Glivec contraindications, warnings and adverse events The majority of patients treated with Glivec in clinical trials experienced adverse events at some time. Most events were of mild to moderate grade and treatment discontinuation was not necessary in the majority of cases. The safety profile of Glivec was similar in all indications. The most common side effects included nausea, superficial edema, muscle cramps, skin rash, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, myalgia, arthralgia, hemorrhage, fatigue, headache, joint pain, cough, dizziness, dyspepsia and dyspnea, dermatitis, eczema, fluid retention, as well as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia. Glivec was generally well-tolerated in all the studies that were performed, either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, with the exception of a transient liver toxicity in the form of transaminase elevation and hyperbilirubinemia observed when Glivec was combined with high-dose chemotherapy. Rare/serious adverse reactions include: sepsis, pneumonia, depression, convulsions, cardiac failure, thrombosis/embolism, ileus, pancreatitis, hepatic failure, exfoliative dermatitis, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, renal failure, fluid retention, edema (including brain, eye, pericardium, abdomen and lung), hemorrhage (including brain, eye, kidney and gastrointestinal tract), diverticulitis, gastrointestinal perforation, tumor hemorrhage/
Japan and Latin America. Diovan has achieved a 40% share of its market segment in the US among angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and has been growing faster than the US anti-hypertensive market. Co-Diovan/Diovan HCT, a single-tablet combination with a diuretic, is now the No. 1 branded antihypertension combination therapy in the US and has benefited worldwide from increasing use of multiple therapies to help patients reach treatment goals. Gleevec/Glivec (USD 2.2 billion, +14% lc), a targeted therapy for certain forms of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), expanded net sales based on improved survival rates for patients, expansion of the GIST market and use in rare diseases. Competition has also expanded the CML market, but it
evaluated by colonoscopy and biopsies. Tasigna[1] (nilotinib) was accepted in late 2006 for both US and EU regulatory review as a new option for patients with resistance and/or intolerance to treatment in certain forms of chronic myeloid leukemia. Phase II registration data, presented in December at the American Society of Hematology annual meeting, showed that Tasigna had impressive efficacy and a manageable safety profile, with patients intolerant to Gleevec/Glivec rarely experiencing the same side-effects on Tasigna . About half of patients treated with Tasigna had significantly reduced or no presence of cells with the defective chromosome that causes this blood cancer. Both Tasigna and Gleevec/Glivec , another Novartis medicine, inhibit Bcr-Abl, the definitive cause of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML). Tasigna was designed to be a more selective inhibitor of Bcr-Abl and its mutations. Lucentis (ranibizumab) is anticipated to receive European Union approval in the coming weeks as a new treatment option for

Results of the International Randomized Interferon versus STI571 (IRIS) were presented today at the 2006 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Data from the IRIS study, the largest clinical trial to date for newly diagnosed adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase, showed the overall survival rate at five years to be 89.4% (range 86% to 92%) for patients receiving Glivec. This considers deaths from all causes, but only 4.6% of the patients died from causes related to their leukemia. Before Glivec was available, about 50% of patients progressed to the more advanced stages of Ph+ CML after only three to five years, and survival was generally short for those patients. The results of this Phase III trial, which was started in June 2000, also showed that the number of patients with

1 × 10 6 tspleen cells from dtg or control mice. Neutrophilia and splenomegaly were present in Bcr–Abl positive tBM and tBM+tspleen cell transplanted mice, 50 days after transplantation ( Figures 4d, e and Supplementary Figure S10 ). However, in addition, neutrophilia was significantly increased in mice receiving combined tBM and tspleen cells in comparison with tBM cells only, although transplanted cell numbers were identical in both groups. Imatinib is less effective on leukemic spleen cells compared with BM cells Splenomegaly is associated with a poor prognosis in CML patients. 16 , 17 To study the therapeutic success of CML therapy on BM vs spleen cells, we extended our analysis of cohorts of mice treated with imatinib or water as previously described 10 for the response of different cell subpopulations from BM and spleen. Engraftment of transplanted cells was confirmed by FACS analysis 27 days after bone marrow transplantation and showed CD45.1 positivity of 83.4±3.2% in BM and 61.8±5.7% in spleen of dtg mice ( n =3) and 85.9±14.6% in BM and 70.8±6.2% in spleen of the controls ( n =3). Mice were then treated with either imatinib or water by oral administration. Mice were killed for analysis 32 days after initiation of treatment. Donor (CD45.1) BM cells were shown to be significantly increased in water-treated dtg mice compared with controls. However, donor cells in imatinib-treated mice were decreased to control levels ( Figure 5a ). Moreover, the increase in granulocytes that was due to an increase in mature donor granulocytes (Gr1 high /CD45.1) in water-treated dtg mice was completely reverted upon imatinib treatment. Contrary to BM, imatinib-treated mice still showed a significant increase of mature leukemic spleen cells compared with controls, and this was true regardless whether total numbers ( Figure 5b ) or the percentage (data not shown) were calculated. The decrease of CD45.1 positive donor spleen cells in dtg imatinib-treated mice was accompanied by an increase of Ter119 positive cells and is thus not due to a therapeutic success but is caused by the increase of CD45 negative erythrocytes ( Figure 5b ). Splenomegaly was only mildly affected by imatinib treatment within 32 days, showing a 2.6-fold increase in dtg water-treated mice and a 1.6-fold increase in imatinib-treated mice, compared with respective controls ( Figure 5c ). Expression of Bcr–Abl was only slightly, but not significantly, decreased in BM or spleen of imatinib-treated mice (data not shown). Figure 5 Effect of imatinib treatment on BM vs spleen cells. 2 × 10 6 control or dtg BM cells (CD45.1) were injected into 9.5 Gy-irradiated recipients ( n ctrl=14/n dtg=15) positive for CD45.2. Imatinib treatment or application of vehicle control was begun 28 days after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) by oral gavage. ( a ) 32 days after continued imatinib or vehicle treatment, a cohort of mice was killed and BM cells were analyzed by FACS for the described immune phenotypes. ( b ) At the same time point total number of spleen cell populations was calculated based upon the percentage of each respective cell population and total spleen cell count. ( c ) Spleen weight was measured upon autopsy. All data are shown as mean±s.e.m. * P <0.05; IM=Imatinib. Full size image Discussion Enlargement of the spleen remains an adverse prognostic factor in CML patients both at diagnosis 16 , 17 and during imatinib treatment, 19 but the exact role of the spleen in the pathogenesis and maintenance of CML is still incompletely understood. Several clinical trials have been conducted to investigate whether targeting the spleen in CML may alter the course of the disease. Although prolonged complete remissions have in fact been documented
to those with other or no mutations. One reason for the different outcome compared to others series 7 , 12 (Corm et al. , Blood 2004; 104 : 82a, abstract) is the patient selection. We analyzed for mutations a subset of patients still in cytogenetic remission, although they had failed to achieve MMR and had increasing transcript levels. Branford et al. 7 included only patients who had received imatinib for at least 6 months or had developed resistance before 6 months. Soverini et al. 12 investigated only patients in CP who failed to achieve an MMR after 12 months of therapy. In our series, 11 patients did not meet the criteria used by Branford et al. 7 and 16
