Over the last decades, substantial evidence has accumulated in favor of this idea as seen in preclinical studies that support the contribution of seminal growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), to smooth muscle hyperplasia in PAH vasculopathy ( 11 ). Efforts to target PDGF in PAH have been undertaken most recently with imatinib, an FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor known to target the PDGF receptor and with documented efficacy in animal models of PAH. Unfortunately, a phase 3 clinical trial (IMPRES) demonstrated modest improvement in clinical parameters and increased rates of intracranial bleeding that have mitigated the early enthusiasm for use of imatinib in patients with PAH ( 12 ). Despite these unexpected results, there is still interest in identifying other candidate growth factors as treatment targets because existing PAH therapies fail to prevent disease progression, possibly by their inability to effectively halt progressive vascular remodeling. As the first among equals, NGF is"

Furthermore, the recent identification of increased expression of both SCF and c-kit in airways of individuals with asthma gives additional support for targeting this activation pathway ( 28 ). However, because imatinib may also have effects on other receptor tyrosine kinase family members, such as PDGFR, the effects observed in this study likely were an outcome of blocking other pathways as well. The responses are also likely to encompass the alteration of bone marrow-derived cells, especially if imatinib is given long term. We found no alteration of circulating leukocyte numbers (data not shown), but have not performed extensive studies to examine bone marrow or peripheral leukocyte counts in the present studies. However, in these studies imatinib was given a single time just before allergen challenge, and the effects may be centered on the alleviation of the inflammatory responses directly activated within the airways. The reduction of chemokines may have resulted from decreased Th2 cytokines as well as the direct effects of blocking specific signaling processes related to specific receptor tyrosine kinase pathways. Previous observations in patients treated with imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia have identified increases in IFN after a 3-month treatment protocol, potentially suggesting an alteration of the overall balance of Th1 and Th2 type responses ( 46 ). In contrast, another study that examined T cell responses in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia before and after imatinib treatment found no difference in the Th1/Th2 cytokine levels on polyclonal activation ( 47 ). Interestingly, data suggest that imatinib may produce long-term, event-free survival in patients with T cell lymphoid blastic phase ( 48 ). Another recent publication has indicated that imatinib treatment affects the development of CD34+ progenitor cells into dendritic cells ( 49 ), further supporting a role for imatinib in altering the development of detrimental immune responses. Related to the current study are previous observations where SCF has been specifically blocked in the airway, either by antibody or antisense therapy, and an alteration in Th2 cytokines observed ( 31 , 32 ). Thus, by blocking the initiation of this"

This study examined the possible enhancing effect of vitamin D on the efficacy of drugs used for the treatment of PNF in vitro. Paired Schwann cells and fibroblasts were cultured from 10 PNFs and treated with imatinib and nilotinib in the absence and presence of calcipotriol, an analogue of the active metabolite of vitamin D. IC 50 values for cell proliferation were calculated. Calcipotriol reduced the IC 50 of the two drugs in both tumorous Schwann cells and non-tumorous fibroblasts by 40 to 45%. Calcipotriol enhanced the efficacy of imatinib and nilotinib on PNF-derived cells in vitro, though rather non-specifically. Nevertheless, sustaining vitamin D at 100-200 nM, the physiological range, may be beneficial for reducing the dose of drugs without scarifying efficacy. \n                                  "

Overall, NVA237 was well tolerated by patients, with the number of adverse events similar to or lower than placebo. These results will form the basis of regulatory filings planned for later this year. A Phase III study showed a significant survival benefit for patients with resected KIT+ gastrointestinal stromal tumors who received adjuvant Glivec (imatinib) treatment for three years following surgery as compared to one year following surgery. The results, gathered five years after surgery, showed that 66% of patients taking adjuvant Glivec therapy for three years remained free of cancer recurrence (primary endpoint) compared to 48% of those who had received adjuvant Glivec therapy for only one year (p\u003c.0001). Moreover, 92% of patients taking Glivec for three years had survived to the five-year mark (secondary endpoint), compared to 82% of those who had received Glivec for only one year (p=.019). These clinical data will be submitted to regulatory authorities in the second half of 2011 to support extended adjuvant Glivec treatment of three years. A Phase III study of Afinitor in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex, the largest prospective clinical trial in Phase III to date in this patient population, met the primary endpoint of reduction in subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) volume.

These include patients with abnormally low potassium or magnesium levels, patients with congenital long QT syndrome, patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicines or other drugs that may lead to QT prolongation. Low levels of potassium or magnesium must be corrected prior to Tasigna administration. Studies have also shown virtually no non-hematologic cross-intolerance between Glivec and Tasigna. (Cross-intolerance occurs when patients cannot tolerate two different drugs because of the same side effects). Causes of non-hematologic intolerance to Glivec included Grade 3 or 4 rash/skin toxicity, fluid retention, gastrointestinal intolerance, liver toxicity, and myalgia/arthralgia. About Glivec Glivec is approved in more than 90 countries including the US, EU and Japan for the treatment of all phases of Ph+ CML. Glivec is also approved in the EU, US and other countries for the treatment of patients with Kit (CD117)-positive gastrointestinal tumors (GIST), which cannot be surgically removed and/or have already spread to other parts of the body (metastasized). In Japan, Glivec is approved for the treatment of patients with Kit (CD117)-positive GIST. In the EU, Glivec is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) in combination with chemotherapy and as a single agent for patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL. Glivec is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable, recurrent and/or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) who are not eligible for surgery. Glivec is also approved for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD). Glivec is also approved for hypereosinophilic syndrome and/or chronic eosinophilic leukemia (HES/CEL). The effectiveness of Glivec is based on overall hematologic and cytogenetic response rates and progression-free survival in CML, on hematological and cytogenetic response rates in Ph+ ALL, and on objective response rates in GIST and DFSP. There are no controlled trials demonstrating increased survival. Not all indications are available in every country. Glivec contraindications, warnings and adverse events The majority of patients treated with Glivec in clinical trials experienced adverse events at some time. Most events were of mild to moderate grade and treatment discontinuation was not necessary in the majority of cases. The safety profile of Glivec was similar in all indications. The most common side effects included nausea, superficial edema, muscle cramps, skin rash, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, myalgia, arthralgia, hemorrhage, fatigue, headache, joint pain, cough, dizziness, dyspepsia and dyspnea, dermatitis, eczema, fluid retention, as well as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia. Glivec was generally well-tolerated in all the studies that were performed, either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, with the exception of a transient liver toxicity in the form of transaminase elevation and hyperbilirubinemia observed when Glivec was combined with high-dose chemotherapy. Rare/serious adverse reactions include: sepsis, pneumonia, depression, convulsions, cardiac failure, thrombosis/embolism, ileus, pancreatitis, hepatic failure, exfoliative dermatitis, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, renal failure, fluid retention, edema (including brain, eye, pericardium, abdomen and lung), hemorrhage (including brain, eye, kidney and gastrointestinal tract), diverticulitis, gastrointestinal perforation, tumor hemorrhage/"

Tasigna[1] (nilotinib) was accepted in late 2006 for both US and EU regulatory review as a new option for patients with resistance and/or intolerance to treatment in certain forms of chronic myeloid leukemia. Phase II registration data, presented in December at the American Society of Hematology annual meeting, showed that Tasigna had impressive efficacy and a manageable safety profile, with patients intolerant to Gleevec/Glivec rarely experiencing the same side-effects on Tasigna . About half of patients treated with Tasigna had significantly reduced or no presence of cells with the defective chromosome that causes this blood cancer. Both Tasigna and Gleevec/Glivec , another Novartis medicine, inhibit Bcr-Abl, the definitive cause of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML). Tasigna was designed to be a more selective inhibitor of Bcr-Abl and its mutations.

Results of the International Randomized Interferon versus STI571 (IRIS) were presented today at the 2006 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Data from the IRIS study, the largest clinical trial to date for newly diagnosed adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase, showed the overall survival rate at five years to be 89.4% (range 86% to 92%) for patients receiving Glivec. This considers deaths from all causes, but only 4.6% of the patients died from causes related to their leukemia. Before Glivec was available, about 50% of patients progressed to the more advanced stages of Ph+ CML after only three to five years, and survival was generally short for those patients. The results of this Phase III trial, which was started in June 2000, also showed that the number of patients with"

Neutrophilia and splenomegaly were present in Bcr–Abl positive tBM and tBM+tspleen cell transplanted mice, 50 days after transplantation ( Figures 4d, e and Supplementary Figure S10 ). However, in addition, neutrophilia was significantly increased in mice receiving combined tBM and tspleen cells in comparison with tBM cells only, although transplanted cell numbers were identical in both groups. Imatinib is less effective on leukemic spleen cells compared with BM cells Splenomegaly is associated with a poor prognosis in CML patients. 16 , 17 To study the therapeutic success of CML therapy on BM vs spleen cells, we extended our analysis of cohorts of mice treated with imatinib or water as previously described 10 for the response of different cell subpopulations from BM and spleen. Engraftment of transplanted cells was confirmed by FACS analysis 27 days after bone marrow transplantation and showed CD45.1 positivity of 83.4±3.2% in BM and 61.8±5.7% in spleen of dtg mice ( n =3) and 85.9±14.6% in BM and 70.8±6.2% in spleen of the controls ( n =3). Mice were then treated with either imatinib or water by oral administration. Mice were killed for analysis 32 days after initiation of treatment. Donor (CD45.1) BM cells were shown to be significantly increased in water-treated dtg mice compared with controls. However, donor cells in imatinib-treated mice were decreased to control levels ( Figure 5a ). Moreover, the increase in granulocytes that was due to an increase in mature donor granulocytes (Gr1 high /CD45.1) in water-treated dtg mice was completely reverted upon imatinib treatment. Contrary to BM, imatinib-treated mice still showed a significant increase of mature leukemic spleen cells compared with controls, and this was true regardless whether total numbers ( Figure 5b ) or the percentage (data not shown) were calculated. The decrease of CD45.1 positive donor spleen cells in dtg imatinib-treated mice was accompanied by an increase of Ter119 positive cells and is thus not due to a therapeutic success but is caused by the increase of CD45 negative erythrocytes ( Figure 5b ). Splenomegaly was only mildly affected by imatinib treatment within 32 days, showing a 2.6-fold increase in dtg water-treated mice and a 1.6-fold increase in imatinib-treated mice, compared with respective controls ( Figure 5c ). Expression of Bcr–Abl was only slightly, but not significantly, decreased in BM or spleen of imatinib-treated mice (data not shown). Figure 5 Effect of imatinib treatment on BM vs spleen cells. 2 × 10 6 control or dtg BM cells (CD45.1) were injected into 9.5 Gy-irradiated recipients ( n ctrl=14/n dtg=15) positive for CD45.2. Imatinib treatment or application of vehicle control was begun 28 days after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) by oral gavage. ( a ) 32 days after continued imatinib or vehicle treatment, a cohort of mice was killed and BM cells were analyzed by FACS for the described immune phenotypes. ( b ) At the same time point total number of spleen cell populations was calculated based upon the percentage of each respective cell population and total spleen cell count. ( c ) Spleen weight was measured upon autopsy. All data are shown as mean±s.e.m. * P \u003c0.05; IM=Imatinib. Full size image Discussion Enlargement of the spleen remains an adverse prognostic factor in CML patients both at diagnosis 16 , 17 and during imatinib treatment, 19 but the exact role of the spleen in the pathogenesis and maintenance of CML is still incompletely understood. Several clinical trials have been conducted to investigate whether targeting the spleen in CML may alter the course of the disease.

It results in juxtaposition of the 5′ part of the BCR gene on chromosome 22 to the 3′ part of the ABL gene on chromosome 9. Since the majority of CML cases are currently treated with Imatinib, variant rearrangements in general have no specific prognostic significance, although the mechanisms involved in resistance to therapy have yet to be investigated. The T315I mutation within the abl-gene is the most frequent one associated with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eResults\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis study evaluated a Ph chromosome positive CML case resistant to imatinib mesylate.

Despite the body of evidence supporting the curative potential of allogeneic HCT in CML, current results with imatinib make it difficult not to recommend a therapeutic trial of imatinib for all newly diagnosed patients. Haematological and cytogenetic response to imatinib may identify those patients in whom an early allograft would be considered appropriate (i.e. those who fail to achieve cytogenetic response within 6–12 months of imatinib therapy from those in whom continued therapy is more appropriate) ( Kantarjian et al , 2003a ; O'Dwyer et al , 2004 ). Although it is widely acknowledged that the advent of imatinib has had a significant impact on the use of allogeneic HCT for CML, data on the number of HCTs now performed and differences in patients now selected for HCT are lacking. A recent report regarding allografting for CML in Europe ( Gratwohl et al , 2006 ), documented a decrease in the numbers of allografts being performed for CML, from 1396 in 1999 to 820 in 2004, but could not account for all the effects of imatinib on the use of allografting in Europe, as this drug was only approved in 2002, and was not available in many Eastern European countries.

Drug treatment is described by a positive time-dependent sequence u ( t ), t =0,1,…, T , which captures the drug dose, and given that there is a dosage limitation due to the drug’s toxicity, u ( t ) is supposed to be bounded in [0, u max ], for t =0,1,…, T . The effects of imatinib treatment are introduced through nonlinear functions, which affect the lifetime of cancer cells, and imply their maximum effect only for an intolerable dosage. In [ 15 ], different scenarios were studied depending on the distinct effects of imatinib on the dynamics. That work concluded that the disease completely remits only when imatinib causes an additional mortality of cancer HSC. In addition, since imatinib is a targeted drug (see [ 37 ]), this is the case with highest plausibility from the biomedical point of view, so we limit our study to this situation. Drug effects are represented by the function h ( u ), which is a nonlinear increasing function satisfying h (0)=0 (this means that cancer HSC declines at baseline rate g 0 without treatment). Clinical evidence also shows that patients rarely develop resistance to imatinib. Indeed, as the eight-year International Randomized Study of Interferon and STI571 (IRIS) trial concluded (see [ 38 ]), resistence to imatinib only appears for 6.75% of patients, and therefore we can assume that the function h only depends on the drug dose u and not on the elapsed treatment time. The behavior under treatment of CML is therefore described by the following system of difference equations: x 0 ( t +"

We analyzed the probability of achieving a CCyR, major molecular response, and progression in 258 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in early chronic phase at 3, 6, and 12 months from imatinib start. The initial imatinib dose was 800 mg/day in 208 (81%) and 400 mg/day in 50 (19%) patients. For patients not in CCyR, the probability of achieving CCyR ( P = .002) or major molecular response ( P = .004) significantly decreased, whereas the risk of progression increased ( P = .16) at each time point. Patients with a BCR-ABL1 / ABL1 ratio greater than 1% to 10% after 3 months of imatinib had a 92% probability of achieving CCyR with continued therapy, similar to the 98% for those with 1% or less, but their risk of progression (11%) was almost 3-fold that of patients with a BCR-ABL1 / ABL1 transcript ratio of 1% or less (4%) and similar to that of patients with transcript levels more than 10% (13%). These results suggest that patients not in CCyR after 12 months on imatinib have a higher risk of progression. This risk is discernible as early as 3 months into imatinib therapy by molecular analysis and may provide the rationale to institute therapies that render higher rates of early response. \n Introduction Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a clonal hematopoietic disorder driven by the constitutively activated BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase oncoprotein. 1 Frontline therapy with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib mesylate resulted in overall cumulative complete hematologic (CHR) and complete cytogenetic (CCyR) response rates of 98% and 82%, respectively, in patients with CML in chronic phase (CP). 2 The use of high-dose imatinib (ie, 800 mg daily) has been associated with a CCyR rate of 89% in patients in CP after failure of interferon-α therapy 3 and in more than 90% in those with newly diagnosed CML CP. 4 The achievement of cytogenetic and molecular responses during imatinib therapy translates into improved event-free survival (EFS) and protection against progression to advanced phases of the disease. 2 These excellent results have consolidated imatinib as standard therapy for patients with CML. After 12 months of imatinib therapy, 69% of patients with CML in early CP are projected to achieve a CCyR. 5 This response rate improves to 82% after 5 years of continuous therapy. 2 However, it remains controversial whether achieving a CCyR early during the course of imatinib therapy confers a prognostic advantage over a CCyR attained at later time points. Initial reports showed that early responses predicted for an improved long-term outcome. 5 , 6 However, recent analyses suggest that the risk of disease progression among patients who achieve a CCyR during the first 12 months of imatinib therapy is similar to that of patients who achieve this response at later time points. 2 , 7 Although some patients may indeed improve their response with continuation of imatinib therapy, a patient not in CCyR at any time faces the dual competing possibilities of either achieving the intended CCyR or eventually progressing. Moreover, the depth of molecular responses obtained during imatinib therapy has important prognostic implications. Among patients in CCyR after 12 months of imatinib therapy, those with a BCR-ABL1 / ABL1 ratio reduction of at least 3-log (ie, major molecular response [MMR]) have been reported to have significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with those with less than a 3-log reduction in BCR-ABL1 mRNA transcripts. 8 By contrast, patients who fail to achieve an MMR during imatinib therapy have an increased risk of losing their cytogenetic response 6 and developing resistance to imatinib and other TKIs. 9 Because the attainment of molecular responses with imatinib is associated with improved long-term outcomes in CML, it is conceivable that measuring the magnitude of reduction in BCR-ABL1 mRNA transcripts may predict, early in the course of therapy, the probability of eventually achieving a CCyR or progressing. In the present study, we investigated the probabilities of improving the cytogenetic response and of eventually progressing for patients not in CCyR at different time points. Our data indicate that failure to attain a CCyR within the first 12 months of imatinib therapy is linked to a higher risk of disease progression. This subset of patients at risk for progression may be identified early in the course of imatinib therapy based on their molecular response. Methods Patients and eligibility criteria Patients 15 years of age or older with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)–positive or BCR-ABL1 –positive CML who received frontline therapy with imatinib in clinical trials at M.

Rutkowski et al 74 reported that primary tumor location was an independent prognostic factor for the prognosis of GISTs. The prognostic features of esophageal GISTs, however, still remain unknown. Considering the significantly different distribution of tumor size and NIH risk category between esophageal and gastric GISTs, patients in the 2 groups were matched by tumor size, mitotic index, and adjuvant imatinib therapy to compare the prognosis between esophageal and gastric GISTs. The survival analysis showed that the DFS and DSS of esophageal GISTs were significantly lower than that of gastric GISTs. There are some limitations of the current study.

Isolated CNS BC is particularly rare, although some cases have been reported even following TKI therapy. Although the ability of imatinib to penetrate the CNS is poor [3] , dasatinib has been shown to better penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) than imatinib in a mouse model of acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) [4] . Various symptoms of CNS BC have been described, including headache and vomiting, which are typical symptoms of brain tumor.

More recently, adjuvant therapy with imitinab has been used with wider indications, such as intermediate-risk tumours with size \u003e 3 cm and primary tumours with rupture or perforation. [41,42] . Of the 21 surviving patients reported in Table 1 , 13 were treated with imatinib, including our case. In the other eight cases, there is no mention of imatinib therapy. Follow-up data are reported for 12 patients, of which 10 were on imatinib adjuvant therapy. All but one were alive without recurrence, with a follow-up ranging from six to 48 months. The only exception was the case reported by Yamamoto and Coll. This patient had multiple hepatic metastases at the time of surgery and later developed peritoneal dissemination. At that time (2001) imatinib was still an investigational chemiotherapic agent and the patient was treated with this experimental therapy with dramatic clinical improvement [9] . 4. Conclusions Emergency presentation with a GIST is not uncommon and one of its manifestations is acute abdomen secondary to intraperitoneal rupture or perforation of a primary GIST of the small intestine. Emergency surgery is mandatory and should achieve radical resection. Primary anastomosis has been reported to be safe. Since there is an increased risk of recurrence after spontaneous intraperitoneal rupture/perforation of GISTs, patients should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team in order to assess the indications for imatinib adjuvant therapy and for close monitoring and follow-up.

The MDC fluorescence level was nearly 20-fold higher than that of Cyto-ID ( Fig. 6A ), as expected. We then asked whether the Cyto-ID-based spectrophotometric assay is more sensitive than the MDC-based assay. The Cyto-ID assay detected an approximately 5-fold increase of Cyto-ID fluorescence when K562 cells were treated with imatinib, whereas the same treatment increased the intensity of MDC fluorescence by only 2.3-fold ( Fig. 6B ). Furthermore, the MDC assay failed to detect the accumulation of autophagosomes in K562 cells treated with chloroquine ( Fig. 6C ). Collectively, these results indicate that Cyto-ID is a more specific and highly sensitive autophagy fluorescence marker. Open in a separate window Figure 6.

However, we noticed different drug responses among mice and at various time points in the same mouse, further demonstrating the necessity to monitor autophagy therapies in the clinic. To mimic clinical application, we generated leukemic mice and then treated them with either imatinib or chloroquine. In mice bearing BCR-ABL-driven leukemia, we found that both imatinib and chloroquine significantly increased the level of Cyto-ID fluorescence in mouse primary bone marrow cells ( Fig. 10B ). Taken together, our results demonstrate that the Cyto-ID assay can be extremely valuable as a diagnostic tool to monitor dose responses of autophagy-related therapies in the clinic.

Objective To explore BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation profiles and clinical variables associated with them in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Methods Imatinib-, nilotinib-, and/or dasatinib-resistant patients with CML who screened BCR-ABL mutation (s) in Peking University People's Hospital between June 2001 and September 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. BCR-ABL mutation was analyzed by Sanger sequencing. Binary logistic regression model was built to identify independent clinical variables associated with developing BCR-ABL mutation (s). Results Data of 1 093 TKI-resistant cases in 804 patients who experienced resistance to imatinib ( n =576, 52.7%), nilotinib ( n =238, 21.8%), and dasatinib ( n =279, 25.5%) were analyzed. In total, 291 (50.5%) imatinib-, 152 (63.9%) nilotinib-, and 160 (57.3%) dasatinib-resistant cases developed BCR-ABL mutation (s). T315I mutation was the most frequent mutation detected in imatinib-, nilotinib-, and dasatinib-resistant cases, accounting for 12.3%, 27.3%, and 34.1%, respectively. Y253F/H (7.5%) and F359V/C/I (5.6%) were the mutation detected in≥5% imatinib-resistant cases; F359V/C/I (12.2%), Y253F/H (11.8%), and E255K/V (10.5%) in nilotinib-resistant cases; and F317L/V/I/C (11.5%) and E255K/V (5.4%) in dasatinib-resistant cases. In multivariate analyses, no TKI dose reduction or discontinuation of TKI therapy was the common variable associated with developing BCR-ABL mutation (s). Other variables associated with developing BCR-ABL mutation (s) in imatinib-, nilotinib-, or dasatinib-resistant cases included male gender, younger age, no comorbidity, advanced phase before starting current TKI therapy, longer interval from diagnosis to starting current TKI therapy, acquired resistance, and TKI resistance due to progression to advanced phase or hematologic failure.

                    "of mice during the final allergen challenges, we find a significant effect on the chronic peribronchial allergen-induced fibrotic remodeling. This was characterized by reduced inflammation, especially eosinophils, as well as reduced hydroxyproline levels in anti-SCF compared to control antibody-treated animals. In addition, when we examined chemokines associated with the chronic disease and neutralized SCF in vivo we observed a corresponding decrease in CCL6 and CCL17. Using an inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, that blocks SCF/c-kit-associated RTK, we find similar results as with anti-SCF for attenuating AHR and fibrotic changes, suggesting that a potential clinical treatment for chronic asthma already exists related to this pathway. These results further support the potential use of SCF/c-kit inhibition for targeting chronic severe asthmatic responses. \n Download"

Taken together, functional deficiencies of BCR-ABL1 -expressing DCs may contribute to the escape from immunosurveillance observed in CML. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells pDCs have emerged as crucial effectors in innate immune responses in CML. Before treatment, CML patients have reduced numbers of circulating pDCs. Moreover, patients who were in complete cytogenetic or molecular response after imatinib treatment restored their blood pDCs both quantitatively and functionally and were comparable to healthy donors [ 47 ]. Contrary to previous studies, data from the EURO-SKI and German CML-V TIGER study recently showed that high numbers of activated CD86+ pDCs were observed in CML patients with molecular recurrence after TKI"

BACKGROUND Cells communicate various aspects of their extracellular environment to the nucleus by using various signal transduction pathways. Many of these, signals are transmitted by protein kinases which activate various factors through the transfer of phosphate groups. Disruption of signal transduction by inhibiting appropriate kinase activity can have a clinical benefit as has been demonstrated by imatinib, an inhibitor of bcr-abl kinase, which is marketed as its mesylate salt under the brand GLEEVEC (in the United States) or GLIVEC. The MAP kinase signaling pathway is known in the art as one of the pathways for growth factors to send their signal to proliferate from the extracellular environment to the cell nucleus. The growth factors activate transmembrane receptors located on the cell surface which in turn start a cascade whereby"

Additionally, inhibition of neddylation using MLN-4924 inhibited the degradation of BCR-ABL1 and ABL1, since VHL neddylation is required for its E3 ligase activity ( FIGS. 5E / 5 F). Combination Treatment with a TP-Competitive BCR-ABL1 TKIs Compounds of Formula (I) and ATP-competitive inhibitors such as imatinib bind at orthogonal sites on protein kinases such as BCR-ABL1. Dose response titrations were performed with BCR-ABL1 transformed Ba/F3 cells for imatinib, Compound 10 and Compound 14 and IC 50 values were determined to be 0.17 μM, 1.11 μM, and 1.55 μM respectively ( FIG. 6A ). The IC 50 of imatinib in the presence of increasing concentrations of Compound 10 or Compound 14 ( FIG. 6A ) was also determined. Unexpectedly, co-treatment with 2.5 μM Compound 10 reduced the IC 50 of imatinib almost 3-fold, likely due to degradation reducing the BCR-ABL1 protein present, suggesting a lower dose of imatinib can entirely abrogate signaling.

Activation of these pathways in CML progenitor cells leads to increased proliferation and differentiation and to decreased apoptosis ( 5 , 6 ). Managing patients with CML has been revolutionized by Bcr‐Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as ATP‐competitive inhibitor imatinib mesylate ( 7 ), which is now standard first‐line therapy. Despite the remarkable safety and effectiveness of imatinib ( 8 ), CML relapses due to drug resistance are not uncommon. Imatinib resistance is caused primarily by mutations in the Bcr‐Abl kinase domain, which disfavors the binding of imatinib ( 9 ). BCR‐ABL point mutations in at least 40 different amino acids were found in \u003e50% of patients who relapsed while on imatinib therapy ( 10 ). The most common mutation, at position Thr315, accounted for up to 20% of imatinib resistance in patients ( 11 ). Although the second‐line Abl kinase inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib, and newly developed allosteric inhibitor GNF‐2, which binds to myristate‐binding site of Abl ( 12 ), target almost all imatinib‐resistant Bcr‐Abl mutants, the gatekeeper mutation T315I remains the most recalcitrant in CML management ( 13"

Four months after starting treatment with dasatinib, the patient was also evaluated for CML: bone marrow analysis showed complete cytogenetic response and undetectable bcr–abl transcript by real-time PCR. This case report leaves us with some open questions: firstly, what mechanisms of dasatinib are involved in gynecomastia? Secondly, why did our patient develop gynecomastia during dasatinib treatment and not when taking imatinib? Thirdly, should we treat CML patients with gynecomastia triggered by tyrosine kinase inhibitors? Our patient had reduced levels of testosterone and free testosterone besides elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP). The rise in 17-OHP could be attributable to an accumulation of steroid precursors consequential to impairment of key enzymes of the steroidogenic cascade, such as 17,20 Lyase (Cyp 17) or 17 ketosteroid reductase. By inhibiting c-kit and PDGFR, imatinib is likely to reduce the cytoplasmatic availability of Cyp 17 and testosterone production. Reduced levels of testosterone seem to be responsible for gynecomastia. Dasatinib is also a potent inhibitor of Src kinases. Recent reports have highlighted the importance of these proteins in transducing testosterone action in Sertoli cells. However, the"

As dasatinib inhibits a number of kinases, we tested a second SRC inhibitor, SrcI ( ), which was developed from a completely different chemical scaffold. We also tested imatinib ( ), which inhibits a number of the same kinases as dasatinib ( ), but did not inhibit phosphorylated SRC(Tyr418), as observed in the immunoblot analysis ( Supplementary Figure 7 , A, available online). When the effects of SrcI and imatinib were tested on three-dimensional cell proliferation in collagen, we found that like dasatinib, SrcI treatment resulted in statistically significantly inhibited growth of cells with high levels of phosphorylated SRC(Tyr418) (SW480+LOX, control vs SrcI-treated, \u003c .001; SW620 control, control vs SrcI-treated, =.014), whereas imatinib had no statistically significant effect ( Supplementary Figure 7 , B, available online).

Together, an overview is provided of treatment strategies in development for CML beyond current TKI monotherapy. \n Introduction Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a malignant myeloproliferative disease driven by the presence of the BCR-ABL1 fusion product generated as a result of the t (9;22) Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). Current treatment revolves around the use of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI) such as imatinib, which inhibit the oncogenic potential of the BCR-ABL1 protein by blocking its kinase domain. However, clinical challenges in the treatment of CML persist. Here, we aim to provide an overview of some new approaches in clinical development for the treatment of CML. We have limited this overview to chronic phase CML as accelerated and blast phase CML are clinically and biologically very distinct disease entities. Prior to the introduction of the TKI imatinib, the main treatment options for CML included allogeneic stem cell transplantation, chemotherapy such as hydroxyureum or busulphan, and interferon. With the revolutionizing treatment potential of imatinib, approved by the FDA and EMA in 2001, the focus since then has been on optimizing the use of TKI therapy. After imatinib, second and third generation TKIs were developed: bosutinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, radotinib, and ponatinib. All these compounds target the ATP binding pocket in the kinase domain of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein, but have a different affinity in the presence of certain mutations in the kinase domain due to variations in their chemical"

This has been possible owing to its ability to target specific receptors and relatively good tolerability. Although the minor side effects of imatinib have been well-described, literature on major side effects is scarce, especially in Ph + ALL. Herein, we report the case of a child with Ph + ALL who succumbed to the serious side effects of imatinib. A 10-year-old boy diagnosed with moderate risk B-ALL, treated as per BFM-95 protocol sustained a combined bone marrow and testicular relapse 30 months after initiation of treatment. At relapse, BCR-ABL chimeric transcript was detected. He had not received imatinib during initial therapy. The 1 week of relapse treatment included dexamethasone (6 mg/m 2 /day) under cover of tumor lysis prophylaxis. After 3 days of dexamethasone, imatinib (300 mg/m 2 ) was added. He was planned to be treated with BFM REZ 2002 protocol. At admission, his physical examination was unremarkable without any signs of cutaneous or mucosal bleed. Hemogram showed hemoglobin 9.1 g/dl, total leukocyte count 1500/μl and platelet count 60,000/μl. Baseline kidney and liver function were normal. On 1 day of admission, even before the planned chemotherapy, he developed multiple episodes of upper GI hemorrhage, necessitating transfer to the intensive care unit. He received packed cells and platelet transfusions along with inotropic support, pantoprazole infusion, and antibiotics. All oral drugs including imatinib were stopped. After initial stabilization, an urgent upper GI endoscopy revealed thickened gastric folds with overlying extensive ulceration involving the entire fundus and body of the stomach, with evidence of active bleeding [ Figure 1 ]. Biopsy was not done for risk of perforation. Coagulation profile was normal. Over next"

                    "GLUT1 and HK1 are not events resulting from inhibited proliferation but could potentially serve as biomarkers to predict the response to and, more importantly, efficacy of EGFR and HER2 TKI treatment. BCR-ABL BCR-ABL harbours a constitutively active form of the ABL TK and is present in more than 90% of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients [ 43 ]. CML treatment was revolutionized by the use of the BCR-ABL TKI imatinib (formerly STI571, Gleevec®), a compound that was writing the first success stories in the field of targeted neoplastic treatment [ 43 ]. Imatinib provides effective and durable therapy: the treatment resulted in 5-year survival of approximately 90% for CML patients in clinical trials [ 44 ]. In 2004, Gottschalk et al. reported that imatinib treatment changed glucose metabolism from anaerobic glycolysis to the aerobic mitochondrial TCA cycle in two human BCR-ABL-positive cell lines CML-T1 and K562 but not in BCR-ABL-negative cell line HC-1 [ 45 ]. Interestingly, metabolic responses to imatinib were dependent on the concentration of the molecule. When using a concentration of 0.25 μmol/L, which is below imatinib’s IC 50 value (for CML-T1 IC 50 is 0.69 ± 0.06 μmol/L and for K562 IC 50 is 0.47 ± 0.04 μmol/L), lactate production was reduced in BCR-ABL-positive cell lines and concurrently, the production of glutamate increased, thus suggesting increased employment of the mitochondrial glucose pathway; when using a concentration above its IC 50 value (2.5 μmol/L), no activation of TCA cycle was observed [ 45 ]. Moreover, imatinib was able to increase extracellular glucose in the lyophilized media of BCR-ABL-positive cell lines in contrary to media coming from the BCR-ABL-negative cell line, where the concentration of extracellular glucose did not change [ 45 ]. Consequently, this resulted in an increased ratio of extracellular to intracelullar glucose and decreased glucose uptake in BCR-ABL-positive cells [ 45 ]. These data correlate with previous findings of Boros et al. who showed that imatinib regulates glycolysis through downregulation of GLUT1 in human leukemia cells [ 46 ]. In fact, BCR-ABL-positive haemopoietic cells TonB210 express high affinity GLUT1 and demonstrate increased glucose uptake [ 47 ]. Following the treatment in vitro, imatinib led to the internalization of 90% of GLUT1 and drastically decreased hexose uptake [ 47 ]. A study carried out by the group of Serkova et al. aimed at understanding of development of imatinib resistance metabolic phenotype in CML, using imatinib-sensitive K562-s and LAMA84-s and imatinib-resistant K562-r and LAMA84-r cell lines [ 48 ]. By using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography mass spectrometry to assess 13 C glucose uptake and metabolism, they showed that in both imatinib-sensitive cell lines, imatinib treatment (1 μmol/L) significantly decreased glucose uptake and lactate export together with reduced [4- 13 C]glutamate, in contrast to imatinib-resistant cell lines, suggesting a decrease in the activity of glycolysis together with TCA cycle [ 48 ]. To confirm their findings, they used 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake assay and showed that imatinib-sensitive cell lines displayed decreased uptake of glucose, compared to imatinib-resistant cell lines that exhibit even higher glucose uptake, as a possible consequence of imatinib resistance progress [ 48 ]. To explain the drop in glucose uptake in imatinib-sensitive cell lines, they reported that imatinib inhibits glycolysis and translocates GLUT1 from the membrane into the cytosol, whereas GLUT1 remains located at the plasma membrane in resistant cell lines [ 48 ]. Interestingly, a decrease in 18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake was previously described in a case report of a patient with a jejunal gastrointestinal stromal tumor with multiple hepatic metastases treated with imatinib [ 49 ]. Studies employing BCR-ABL targeted therapy provided a rationale for the combined use of an inhibitor of glucose metabolism and kinase inhibitors for treatment of BCR-ABL-positive patients who acquired resistance either to classical chemotherapy or to the targeted treatment.

Effect Is Dose Sensitive He noted that the effect of imatinib is very dose sensitive and that a dose below 300 mg is not effective. The study data indicate that 400 mg daily is an acceptable dosage, but that a higher dose (800 mg) may be more effective.

Furthermore, the method requires inoculating the reaction mixture with the seeds of the α-crystal form and the yield of crystallization hardly exceeds 80%. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based upon the experimental finding that in some cases, when certain solvents or mixtures thereof are used, the obtained α-crystal or β-crystal forms of Imatinib methanesulfonate or their mixture additionally contains morphologically different, previously-unidentified crystals. Dissimilarity of the isolated crystals and the known crystalline forms of Imatinib methanesulfonate has been confirmed by the X-ray structure analysis and the IR spectrum. Analysis of the isolated crystals by the proton magnetic resonance (NMR) method has demonstrated that they are the acid addition salt of 4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl)-N-[4-methyl-3-[4-pyridin-3-yl)pyrimidin-2-ylamino]phenyl]benzamide with two molecules of methanesulfonic acid, i.e. Imatinib dimethanesulfonate, hereinafter referred to as Imatinib dimesylate. The discovery of a simultaneous formation of the different crystalline forms of Imatinib monomethanesulfonate and Imatinib dimethanesulfonate, depending upon crystallization conditions, has allowed for developing a more selective method of preparing the α-crystal form of the methanesulfonic acid addition salt of 4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl)-N-[4-methyl-3-[(4-pyridin-3-yl)pyrimidin-2-ylamino]phenyl]benzamide, hereinafter referred to as Imatinib monomesylate. It was found that by using not more than 0.99 equivalents of methanesulfonic acid per 1.00 equivalent of 4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl)-N-[4-methyl-3-[(4-pyridin-3-yl)pyrimidin-2-ylamino]phenyl]benzamide in the addition reaction allows for obtaining the α-crystal form of Imatinib monomesylate that is essentially free of detectable amounts of Imatinib monomesylate β-crystal form as well as of any Imatinib dimesylate crystalline forms. Unexpectedly, it has been found also that by restricting the stoichiometric ratio of the reactants it is possible to extend possibility of obtaining the essentially pure α-crystal form of Imatinib monomesylate, in particular to extend the range of usable solvents or their mixtures of a definite composition. However, in some cases, e.g. in case of using a mixture of ethyl alcohol and methyl-tert-butyl ether, formation of Imatinib dimesylate could not be avoided. It seems that in case of certain solvents, the equilibrium between Imatinib free base, Imatinib monomesylate and Imatinib dimesylate is attained, despite using less than 1.00 equivalents of methanesulfonic acid per 1.00 equivalent of Imatinib: Therefore, a process has been developed that under certain conditions allows for eliminating the need of seeding the crystallization mixture with α-crystal form, by combining the use of the reagents in the stoichiometric ratio of less than 1.00:0.99 with the use of appropriate solvents. Under these conditions, the addition of",

Importantly, the combination severely impaired engraftment into untreated secondary recipients, with some recipients never developing the disease, demonstrating a dramatic decrease in CML LIC activity.

                    "belong to a group of cancers known as soft tissue sarcomas(2). The most common sarcomas, they can be found most often in the stomach and small bowel(2). In the EU, the incidence of GIST is estimated to be more than 5,000 cases per year(6),(7), of which approximately 95% are Kit-positive(2). Kit is the protein that, when mutated, has been identified as one of the major causes of GIST. Glivec inhibits the activity of Kit, as well as several other proteins(2).   About Glivec Glivec is approved in more than 90 countries including the US, EU and Japan, for the treatment of all phases of Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Glivec is also approved in the US, EU and other countries for the treatment of patients with Kit (CD117)-positive gastrointestinal tumors (GIST), which cannot be surgically removed and/or have already spread to other parts of the body (metastasized). In the US and EU, Glivec is now approved for the post-surgery treatment of adult patients following complete surgical removal of Kit (CD117)-positive gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In the EU, Glivec is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) in combination with chemotherapy and as a single agent for patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL. Glivec is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable, recurrent and/or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) who are not eligible for surgery and for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD). In addition, Glivec is approved for hypereosinophilic syndrome and/or chronic eosinophilic leukemia (HES/CEL).   The effectiveness of Glivec is based on overall hematological and cytogenetic response rates and progression-free survival in CML; on hematological and cytogenetic response rates in Ph+ ALL and MDS/MPD; on hematological response rates in systemic mastocytosis (SM) and HES/CEL; on objective response rates and progression-free survival in unresectable and/or metastatic GIST; on recurrence-free survival in adjuvant GIST and on objective response rates in DFSP. Increased survival in controlled trials has been demonstrated only in newly diagnosed chronic phase CML and GIST.   Not all indications are available in every country.   Important safety information The majority of patients treated with Glivec in clinical trials experienced adverse events at some time. Most events were of mild to moderate grade and treatment discontinuation was not necessary in the majority of cases.   The safety profile of Glivec was similar in all indications. The most common side effects included nausea, superficial edema, muscle cramps, skin rash, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, myalgia, arthralgia, hemorrhage, fatigue, headache, joint pain, cough, dizziness, dyspepsia and dyspnea, dermatitis, eczema and fluid retention, as well as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia. Glivec was generally well-tolerated in all of the studies that were performed, either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, with the exception of a transient liver toxicity in the form of transaminase elevation and hyperbilirubinemia observed when Glivec was combined with high dose chemotherapy.   Rare/serious adverse reactions include: sepsis, pneumonia, depression, convulsions, cardiac failure, thrombosis/embolism, ileus, pancreatitis, hepatic failure, exfoliative dermatitis, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, renal failure, fluid retention, edema (including brain, eye, pericardium, abdomen and lung), hemorrhage (including brain, eye, kidney and gastrointestinal tract), diverticulitis, gastrointestinal perforation,"

The current study is focused on comparing the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)/imatinib combination therapy to single (MSCs or imatinib) therapy, in a rat model of carbon tetrachloride (CCL4)-induced liver fibrosis. Using rats, hepatic fibrosis was induced by injection of CCL4. Rats were divided into 5 groups: CCL4-induced hepatic fibrosis, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) treatment (vehicle control), Bone marrow-MSCs (BM_MSCs), imatinib, and bone marrow-MSCs/imatinib co-treatment. The therapeutic impact of these approaches was determined using histopathology, sirius-red staining, serum markers, and qRT-PCR for over expression of matrix components. IHC and Western blot were conducted for further confirmation of the results. Single treatment with MSCs or imatinib and the combination therapy, all significantly reduced serum levels of ALT, AST, and ALP concomitant with down-regulation of α-SMA, pro-collagen I, pro-collagen III, collagen IV, and laminin. A significant reduction of ECM components deposits and a decrease in α-SMA expression were detected in all treatment groups. Pathological observations demonstrated that 20% and 40% of the rats in the MSC and MSC/imatinib group were in grade F0 respectively, while 80% of the rats of the imatinib group were in grade 2. Even though all treatment strategies studied resulted in an equally potent reduction in the mRNA and protein expression levels of pro-fibrotic markers, in aspect of pathological observations, our results demonstrate the highest therapeutic potential of utilizing combination of BM-MSCs and imatinib. \n                               \n                                                                  "

                    "the majority of patients present to rheumatology clinics with some degree of established fibrosis. Thus, treatment of established fibrosis is a frequent and urgent aim in this disease. In these patients, treatment would remove preexisting fibrotic changes and potentially reduce organ dysfunction. Using a modified model of bleomycin‐induced dermal fibrosis in which the application of bleomycin was prolonged and the onset of treatment was late, we demonstrate that imatinib not only halts progression of fibrosis but even reduces preexisting dermal fibrosis and decreases dermal thickness below pretreatment levels despite ongoing challenge with the profibrosis stimulus bleomycin. Thus, imatinib not only might stop progression but also might induce regression of tissue fibrosis. Imatinib might therefore also be an interesting candidate for clinical trials in SSc patients with extensive, longstanding disease and preexisting fibrotic organ damage. However, potential antiangiogenic adverse effects of imatinib are an important concern, particularly in patients with SSc who have severe microvascular disease and recurrent ulcers. Although imatinib might not affect endothelial cells directly ( 15 ), careful monitoring of patients with SSc for exacerbation of vascular disease is warranted in clinical trials with imatinib. Taken together, our results show that imatinib exerted potent antifibrotic effects in 2 in vivo models of SSc with different underlying pathologic mechanisms. Imatinib was effective for the prevention of fibrosis and the treatment of established dermal fibrosis. Furthermore, imatinib also exerted potent antifibrotic effects in preclinical models of other fibrotic diseases ( 7 - 9 ). The results of the present study indicate that combined inhibition of c‐Abl and PDGF receptor might be effective for the treatment of established fibrosis as well. These findings enhance our excitement about the upcoming results of clinical trials with imatinib in SSc and other fibrotic disorders. The results from these trials, including their safety analyses, must be awaited before imatinib can be used routinely in the daily clinical care of patients with SSc. \n                               \n                                        "

Patients with newly diagnosed brain tumors that were radiogically consistent with glioblastoma multiforme were evaluated clinically and, if eligible, were accrued to the protocol. The tumor was biopsied under computerized tomography (CT) guidance. Once glioblastoma multiforme diagnosis was confirmed, the patient was started on imatinib 400 mg orally, twice daily for 7 d (14 doses). Corticosteroid dose had to remain stable throughout the 7 d, and the only antiepileptic agent allowed was valproic acid because it does not induce the CYP3A4 major p450 human enzymes that catalyze imatinib biotransformation. Six to twenty-four hours after the last dose of imatinib the patients underwent definitive (cytoreductive) surgery or, if not resectable, a second CT-guided biopsy. For two patients, however, surgery was delayed. For the first patient, the delay was due to intensive care unit unavailability, whereas the second patient developed pulmonary complications that required hospitalization and mechanical support.

Therefore we can exclude a lack of interaction between Helix‐2 and p185 (BCR/ABL‐T315I) as a reason for resistance against the peptide. In summary our data indicate that p185 (BCR/ABL‐T315I) forms a subset of complexes unresponsive towards Helix‐2 that provides a sufficient survival signal. Regarding the response of mutated BCR/ABL towards Imatinib in presence of Helix‐2, we found that Helix‐2 expression overcomes the Imatinib‐resistance of p185 (BCR/ABL‐Y253F) and p185 (BCR/ABL‐E255K) but not of p185 (BCR/ABL‐T315I) . The fundamental difference between T315I and Y253F or E255K might be due to the gatekeeper function of T315. It is widely accepted that Imatinib binds to the inactive ABL‐kinase conformation 14 and thus one can hypothesize that the inhibition of the BCR/ABL TK‐activity caused by the interaction with Helix‐2 is related to conformational changes in the ABL‐kinase domain that increase the affinity towards Imatinib of mutations that do not confer complete resistance such as the p‐loop mutations. Here we show for the first time that p185 (BCR/ABL) harboring mutations related to Imatinib‐resistance are responsive to the inhibition of the tetramerization by Helix‐2 in classical transformation assays.

                    ". PDGFRβ, however, plays a predominant role overall, as demonstrated in mice in which the cytoplasmic domains between PDGFRα and PDGFRβ were swapped. These experiments revealed that the PDGFRβ intracellular domain could fully substitute for the PDGFRα. In contrast, replacement of the PDGFRβ cytoplasmic domain with that of the α-receptor caused abnormalities in vascular smooth muscle cell development and function [30] . The use of the small-molecule inhibitor STI571 (imatinib mesylate or gleevec) has been reported to block PDGFRs and reduce the expansion of cancer cells within the bone [31] , [32] . However, the inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects of STI571 seem to be exerted prevalently on PDGFRβ expressed in endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature rather than directly affecting prostate cancer cells. Alternatively, the toxicity reported in phases I and II clinical trials, which in most cases had to be interrupted [33] , [34] , may explain the ability of STI571 to comparably block PDGFRα and PDGFRβ. In addition, pre-clinical animal studies investigating the survival role of PDGFRs for cancer cells and the effects exerted by STI571 were almost exclusively conducted using animal models in which bone tumors were produced by directly implanting cancer via an intra-osseous route. While this approach significantly shortens the duration of each experiment, it also bypasses the initial stages of lodging and colonization of the bone marrow. Therefore, the peculiar histopathologic features produced by this intra-osseous approach, as compared to naturally established and progressing skeletal metastases, might also explain the disappointing effects of STI571 in clinical trials. It seems plausible that the selective inactivation of PDGFRα, employing a monoclonal antibody rather than a broad-range inhibitor such as STI571, could limit the survival of malignant cells that depend on it while causing limited side effects, due to the largely duplicate role exerted by PDGFRβ [35] . However, in the event that PDGFRα in prostate cancer cells undergoes transactivation when in the bone marrow microenvironment, an antibody that would target"

                    "CML ( 10 ). The methylation status of the BCR promoter, however, has rarely been investigated in CML. If BCR promoter DNA methylation actually controls transcription of the BCR-ABL fusion gene in CML, then the methylation status of the BCR promoter should exhibit a correlation with disease status. Furthermore, the methylation status of BCR may also be used as a predictive marker during tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Imatinib (Gleevec ® ; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) is the most commonly used TKI therapy for all phases of CML [chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP) and blast crisis (BC)] ( 11 ). Approximately 10–15% of CML patients treated with imatinib as first-line therapy suffer disease progression ( 12 ). Furthermore, imatinib is associated with secondary resistance ( 13 , 14 ). For patients who fail to respond to first-line standard dose imatinib therapy, dose-escalated imatinib is a reasonable option, along with second generation TKIs. We previously performed a prospective multi-center single-arm phase IV study in which escalated doses of imatinib were administered to Korean patients who had less than optimal response to the standard dose imatinib ( 15 ). The present study demonstrated considerable efficacy of dose-escalated imatinib in CML patients, showing suboptimal response to standard dose imatinib. Moreover, early molecular response, defined as a reduction in the BCR-ABL/ABL ratio by more than 50% within 6 months, was found to be a surrogate marker for long-term response. On the other hand, the BCR-ABL mutation rate was relatively low in the suboptimal responders to imatinib, and the mutation status did not affect the outcome of escalated dose imatinib therapy. Consequently, BCR promoter DNA methylation analysis was performed i) to reveal the role of the BCR promoter in the transcriptional control of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, and ii) to investigate epigenetic predictive markers for response and long-term outcome of imatinib dose escalation treatment. For further comparison, BCR promoter DNA methylation status was analyzed in another two groups. The second group included patients who achieved complete cytogenetic remission after receiving 400 mg/day imatinib (optimal responders) and the third group were healthy controls. Materials and methods Study population A total of 71 Korean patients from 19 centers in Korea were enrolled in this study between 2005 and 2006. The BCR promoter DNA methylation status was evaluated in three groups of subjects. The first group comprised CP CML patients enrolled in the imatinib dose escalation study. The study design and results of this imatinib dose escalation trial were described elsewhere ( 15 ). Briefly, this open-label, single-arm, multi-center phase IV study enrolled CML patients between 15 and 75 years of age with adequate organ function. Patients in CP with a less than optimal response to standard dose imatinib were included. Patients in AP or BC who failed to achieve complete hematologic response after 3 months of imatinib were also eligible. Those patients who experienced more than grade 2 adverse events to the standard imatinib dose were excluded. Imatinib was administered orally at 600 mg/day for CP patients. Escalation to 800 mg/day imatinib was permitted for patients in AP or BC. Patients received dose-escalated imatinib for at least 12 months or until progressive disease or intolerable toxicity occurred. Cytogenetic response (CyR) was assessed every 6 months. Molecular response (MR) was assessed every 3 months with standardized BCR-ABL/ABL of a peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate using real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR.

The mean reduction of the virus titer in the spleen after transfer of memory CTLs in nontreated mice was reduced 1600-fold on day 3 and 30 000-fold on day 4 compared with control C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, memory CTLs in imatinib-treated mice reduced the virus titer only 140-fold on day 3 and 800-fold on day 4 compared with control C57BL/6 mice. Imatinib has been shown to reduce vaccinia virus replication. 31 In contrast, LCMV titers in the spleen 4 days after infection were comparable in imatinib-treated and nontreated mice. In addition, imatinib did not impair LCMV replication in vitro in MC57-infected cells (S.M., unpublished results, August 2005). In summary, the reduced secondary expansion of memory CTLs in the presence of imatinib resulted in impaired protection against reinfection. Imatinib delays the onset of autoimmune diabetes An impaired secondary expansion of CTLs in the presence of imatinib may be useful in the treatment of CTL-mediated autoimmune diseases. We analyzed this possibility in a murine model of diabetes. RIP-GP mice express the LCMV-GP under the rat insulin promoter in the pancreatic β cells. 18 In these mice, activation of LCMV-GP–specific CTLs results in the destruction of the pancreatic islets and the onset of diabetes. Memory p14 T cells were adoptively transferred to imatinib-treated and nontreated RIP-GP mice. One and 5 days later, the mice were immunized with LCMV gp33-expressing DCs generated from H8 mice, and the blood-glucose concentration was measured thereafter ( Figure 7B ). Imatinib treatment delayed the onset of diabetes, and blood-glucose levels were lower in imatinib-treated mice compared with non-treated mice. In one imatinib-treated mouse, diabetes was prevented completely during the treatment and blood-glucose concentration only increased 4 days after imatinib treatment had been stopped (data not shown). In contrast, all nontreated mice died from diabetes within 10 days after DC immunization. Therefore, imatinib treatment delayed the onset of CTL-mediated immunopathological sequel and diabetes.

CML leukemic cells present abnormaladhesion to medullar stroma, altered proliferation and an amazingresistance to apoptosis induced by classical chemotherapeuticdrugs. Another therapy used in CML patients is imatinib mesylate(Gleevecâ), which has shown remarkable clinical activity in thesepatients.

The observation that production ofBcr-Abl is the initiating event in CML drew attention to the survivalsignals triggered by this oncogene.

Interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (I-FISH) was performed on the bone marrow samples using LSI bcr/abl dual ES color (Vysis, Voisins le Bretonneux, France), as previously described. At least 300 interphase cells were scored for signal patterns. The analysis was completed using appropriate centromeric probes, depending upon the results of conventional cytogenetics. Cytogenetic studies were sequentially performed on 46 CML patients receiving imatinib. Six (13%) had no cytogenetic response, four (8.7%) a minor cytogenetic response, one (2.2%) a partial cytogenetic response, six (13%) a major cytogenetic response, and 29 (63%) a complete cytogenetic response. Among those 29 patients achieving a complete cytogenetic response, three (10.3%) developed clonal chromosomal abnormalities in the Ph-negative cells ( ). All patients were males, aged between 50 and 73 years. The first patient was diagnosed in March 2000 and received interferon alfa combined with aracytidine for almost 2 years without results. He was put on imatinib in February 2002 and lost the Y chromosome in his medullary cells after 15 months of treatment. The second patient, diagnosed in July 2001, received hydroxyurea during 45 days before imatinib; this patient never received interferon. At 18 months after imatinib was started, 45 X–Y cells were found in his marrow cells. The Y chromosome loss was confirmed by interphase FISH in both patients. The third patient received hydroxyurea following the diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia in June 2001 to reduce his white blood cells (WBC) count. He was then put under imatinib (400 mg/day) and aracytidine (40 mg/day, 14 days a month), without having been treated with interferon alfa. The dosage of aracytidine had to be reduced because of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, before being stopped after 6 months. At 8 months of treatment, neutropenia (WBC 3.1 × 10 9 /l with 17% neutrophils) and thrombocytopenia (platelets 86 × 10 9 /l) persisted. The conventional cytogenetic analysis at 10 months under imatinib showed the disappearance of the Philadelphia chromosome in all 21 metaphases examined; a monosomy 7, confirmed by interphase FISH, was found in 19 metaphases. The patient has remained under imatinib (400 mg/day). When last seen 22 months after imatinib was started, he was still bicytopenic (WBC 2.5 × 10 9 /l with 19% neutrophils and platelets 74 × 10 9 /l); the monosomy 7 was still present in 13 of the 21 metaphases analysed. In all the three patients, the BCR–ABL fusion gene signal was absent in all 300 cells examined by interphase FISH at the time the other chromosomal abnormalities appeared. Interphase FISH performed retrospectively on all three patients showed the absence of nullisomy Y or monosomy 7 in the samples taken prior to imatinib treatment. This report documents the emergence of clonal chromosomal abnormalities in Philadelphia-negative cells of three CML patients under imatinib achieving a complete cytogenetic response, as reported by other workers. At present, data on 1584 patients are available. Among the 49 patients with an abnormal Philadelphia-negative clone, 43 had achieved a MCR or CCR at the time the clone appeared. There is no doubt that patients responding very well at the imatinib treatment are at a higher risk of developing cytogenetic abnormalities in the Ph-negative cells. The frequency of patients developing clonal chromosomal abnormalities in their Ph chromosome-negative cells remain unknown because large trials of imatinib treatment usually do not report them, while studies dedicated to their emergence induce a bias toward reporting them. Overall, 60 patients with an abnormal Philadelphia-negative clone have been published thus far, including 49 patients reported in series and 11 as case reports; 34 (56.7%) had a trisomy 8, 11 (18.3%)"

It is even possible that the spectrum of activity of AG957 includes inhibition of kinases critical for signaling from the IL-3 and GM-CSF receptors, which would have masked the recognition of its effect on p210 bcr-abl in the assays we performed. In contrast, the inhibitory effect observed in these and other 10 assays strongly implicates an effect of STI571 on the p210 bcr-abl kinase. In our own experiments, in the presence of growth factor, STI571 showed up to 17-fold greater potency for p210 bcr-abl -expressing derivatives of cell lines than for parental cell lines (Table 1 ). As a biological test of biochemical specificity, we based our assays on cell lines with a p210 bcr-abl -driven specific phenotype—the acquisition of factor independence—and, as has been previously observed, 10 STI571 reversed this back to the factor-dependent phenotype of nontransfected cells. To determine its spectrum of activity, STI571 has been specifically tested against a broad range of protein kinases. 10 12 Although our experiments and those of others 10 indicate that STI571 acts on cellular p210 bcr-abl , these surveys of its activity indicate that it is not totally specific.

Treatment Design Prior studies confirmed that the metabolism of imatinib is significantly enhanced by concurrent use of EIAEDs. Therefore, patients were accrued independently into two separate strata: patients not taking EIAEDs (stratum A) and patients taking EIAEDs (stratum B).

Cohorts of three to six patients were treated per dose level. Imatinib was provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals (Florham Park, NJ, USA) and was given orally with food on days 1–8 of each 28-day cycle. On days 4–8 of each cycle, patients were advised to take their imatinib 2–3 h before their TMZ dose. Daily imatinib doses greater than 600 mg were split equally into two doses; otherwise, dosing was once a day.

In fact, c-Abl regulates downstream molecules which are associated with cell death/survival, including p73, p63, p53, PKCδ, retinoblastoma (RB), c-Jun, IκBα and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [ 8 - 10 , 13 , 16 ]. The direct transactivation of PUMA and Bax, and the expression of death receptors by p73 were demonstrated to contribute to c-Abl-mediated apoptosis [ 17 , 18 ]. STI571 (imatinib, Gleevec ® ) is a specific inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, such as Bcr-Abl, c-Abl, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and c-Kit [ 19 ]. It was approved for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors with constitutively active Bcr-Abl and c-Kit [ 20 - 22 ]. As a front-line therapy, STI571 is tremendously successful; however, STI571-resistant clones that allow the disease to progress are appearing and increasing. Thus the management of patients who are resistant to STI571 with many conventional chemotherapeutic agents still needs to be resolved. Moreover, recent studies showing that c-Abl is highly active in many aggressive breast cancer cell lines and involved in cancer cell metastasis, proliferation, and survival have raised strong interest in investigating STI571's effects in other solid tumors [ 15 ]. In an effort to achieve better cancer therapy, the possibility of combining TRAIL and STI571 in various cancer types is worth investigating. In fact, studies showed that when co-treating STI571 with TRAIL, K562 (a Bcr-Abl-positive human leukemia cell line) and melanoma cells are more sensitive to death [ 23 , 24 ]. Moreover, reports indicate that TRAIL can induce cell death in CML cells that are refractory to STI571, and vice versa STI571 can overcome TRAIL resistance in K562 cells [ 25 - 27 ]. In this report we extend to study this combination in colon and prostate cancer cells. Both STI571 and TRAIL alone have been reported to exert antitumor activity in colon cancer cells [ 28 , 29 ]. Intriguingly, in this study we found that STI571 can attenuate TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity in colon cancer cells, whereas it cannot affect TRAIL's effect in prostate cancer cells. We presented evidence that c-Abl mediation of TRAIL-induced JNK and p38 activation is involved in the death of colon cancer cells, but not of prostate cancer cells. Moreover, p73 is the downstream effector of c-Abl which propagates signals to JNK and p38. Methods Reagents TRAIL was purchased from PeproTech (London, UK). STI571 was kindly provided by Norvartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland). Rabbit monoclonal antibodies specific for caspase 3 and 8, phosphorylated p38, JNK, ERK, and c-Abl were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Mouse antibodies for c-Abl, JNK1, p38, and β-actin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA)."

Consequently, hyperphosphorylation of key Bcr-Abl substrates promotes leukemogenesis in myeloid cells ( 2 ). Exciting advances in molecular medicine have yielded imatinib mesylate/STI571/Gleevec, an inhibitor of Abl activity, which has proved to be effective in many patients with CML ( 3 ). Unfortunately, a subset of patients afflicted with myeloid leukemias initially exhibit imatinib resistance, whereas others become refractory to treatment owing to development of drug resistance caused by subsequent mutations in abl ( 4 – 7 ).

TKI nonresponded GISTs were correlated with decreased DEPDC5 expression compared to responded GISTs. To investigate whether this modification of the TKI sensitivity could be recapitulated in a clinical setting, we performed DEPDC5 qRT-PCR analysis on a set of GIST biopsies from patients treated with KIT inhibitors. Resistance to KIT inhibitors, such as imatinib, in GIST most commonly involves secondary point mutations in the KIT kinase domain that reduce or abrogate drug potency ( 2 ). We removed the GISTs with secondary KIT mutations from the analyses. We observed that TKI-nonresponded GISTs were correlated with decreased DEPDC5 expression compared to responded GISTs ( Fig."

Results Cellular and molecular assays and microarray data validation Cell samples were collected at 6 time points from each of the 3 drug treatment series and first subjected to different assays to evaluate cellular and molecular responses of K562 cells. As demonstrated in Figure 1A , cell viability is markedly reduced in cells treated with ATO, imatinib mesylate, or imatinib mesylate plus ATO, and the strongest reduction of cell viability is revealed in the cotreatment series. When cell apoptosis was evaluated, a synergistic induction of apoptosis was observed in cells cotreated with imatinib mesylate and ATO ( Figure 1B-C ). Although treatment with ATO alone results in a considerable reduction of cell viability, its impact on apoptosis seems to be limited within the observation time (ie, 72 hours).

CEACAM1 transcription was shown to be reduced following culturing of BCR/ABL-positive c6 cells in 1 μ M imatinib mesylate for 24 h. Treatment with imatinib mesylate was initiated at the same time as BCR/ABL was induced with 1 μ g/ml doxycycline.

Full size image CEACAM1 expression in K562 cells is reversed by treatment with imatinib mesylate To study if the effect of BCR/ABL on CEACAM1 expression in c6 and e9 cells was extendable to other cells expressing the same fusion gene, the expression of CEACAM1 in K562 cells, following imatinib treatment, was investigated by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis. A clear decrease in CEACAM1 expression was detected, indicating that BCR/ABL also regulates CEACAM1 expression in another cellular context ( Figure 8 ). Serial dilutions of the cDNA used for RT-PCR analysis showed that the assay allowed a semiquantitative estimation of the expression levels of CEACAM1 (data not shown).

Edwards reaffirmed his buy recommendation in a report last month, citing Novartis' \"strength in its current arsenal of products and the potential in its pipeline.\" Rauch initiated a buy rating in early September just before the stock made a fourth-quarter surge. At the time, he focused on the sales growth of Diovan for hypertension, Gleevec for cancer and Zometa for bone pain caused by cancer. He said Novartis could enjoy as many as six product approvals in the U.S. by the end of 2007, adding that only one major product, the nail fungus treatment Lamisil, could lose patent protection before 2010. Rauch doesn't own shares, and his firm doesn't have an investment-banking relationship, although his research report says the firm or an officer owns shares of Novartis. Since raising his rating, Rauch has issued research reports noting more promising results for Gleevec in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a slowly progressing disease, and favorable early-stage clinical trial results for a compound that treats patients with Gleevec-resistant CML. Also encouraging are the preliminary results for a midstage clinical trial for valopicitabine, an experimental treatment for hepatitis C from Novartis' partner Idenix. Last week,"

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a graph showing that bosutinib, but not the related compounds imatinib and dasatinib, promotes increase in vascular barrier function in vitro. Primary human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were grown to confluence. Steady state barrier function was monitored by Electrical Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) for 24 hours and normalized to a value of 1. As indicated (vertical arrow), single 300 nM doses of bosutinib (Bosu; circles), imatinib (Ima; squares) dasatinib (Dasa; diamonds), or vehicle control (Con; triangles) were added and resistance was monitored for an additional 3 hours. Data are mean±SEM of three independent experiments. Observed increases in resistance following addition of bosutinib are a direct reflection of increased vascular integrity and barrier function. Conversely the observed decreases in resistance following dasatinib addition reflect decreased vascular integrity and barrier function. The unchanged resistance following addition of imatinib indicates no change in barrier function. FIG. 2 is a graph showing that bosutinib promotes sustained, dose-dependent increase in vascular barrier function in vitro. Primary bovine aortic endothelial cells were grown to confluence. Steady state barrier function was monitored by ECIS for 24 hours and normalized to a value of"

Thus, the pharmacokinetic effect is apparently due to the induction of intestinal P-gp caused by multiple doses of SJW high in hyperforin. The anticancer drug imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is a strong inhibitor of specific tyrosine kinases that promote tumor cell proliferation ( Collins and Workman 2006 ). Imatinib is transported by P-gp and metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 ( Peng, Lloyd, and Schran 2005 ). Two studies have shown SJW interacts with imatinib. Frye et al. (2004) found that 2 weeks of SJW treatment on 10 healthy subjects decreased the AUC by 32%. When working with 12 healthy subjects receiving SJW extracts, Smith et al. (2004) , likewise, found increased clearance and reduced AUC and Cmax for imatinib. SJW has been shown to affect the pharmacokinetics of the drug amitriptyline, a tertiary amine tricyclic antidepressant metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 ( Venkatakrishnan, von Moltke, and Greenblatt 1999 ). A clinical study of 12 patients taking both SJW and amitriptyline exhibited a decrease in AUC"

This compound potently inhibits Bcr–Abl, the fusion protein that causes the onset of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia, and it also inhibits the receptor tyrosine kinases c-KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor that have a role in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Dasatinib (BMS-354825, Sprycel; Bristol-Meyers Squibb, New York, NY, USA) is an ATP-competitor that is structurally unrelated to imatinib and has been approved for the treatment of imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia. Dasatinib has greater potency against Bcr–Abl and is effective against various imatinib-resistant Bcr–Abl mutants. However, it is also less specific and its range of targets includes the family of Src kinases, whose members have important roles in the growth and differentiation of various cell types. Both imatinib and dasatinib have been shown to suppress T-cell functions, although the reasons for this are not fully established. The intracellular tyrosine kinase Lck is essential for the development and activation of T-cells and previous studies have shown that purified recombinant Lck can be inhibited by dasatinib and imatinib. Moreover, a large-scale kinome screen on recombinant kinase domains showed that imatinib binds to Lck, but not to the related Fyn and Src kinases. As data obtained with purified proteins do not always translate to in vivo conditions, we set out to validate the selectivity profile of imatinib and dasatinib in a cellular context. We also aimed to obtain novel insights into the T-cell suppressive activities of these drugs and established that dasatinib inhibits T-cell function at clinically relevant concentrations, primarily through inhibition of Lck. To compare the effects of imatinib on cellular Lck and other Src kinases, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs for constitutively active Lck, Fyn or Src. These proteins are active because of a phenylalanine substitution at the inhibitory tyrosine (Y505 in Lck) in the regulatory tail, and their activity can be assayed by the phosphorylation of another tyrosine in the ATP-binding site (Y394 in Lck, Y420 in Fyn and Y416 in Src). Incubation of cells with 6.25 μ M imatinib for 2 h resulted in a considerable reduction in Y394 phosphorylation of Lck ( ). Calculated over three separate experiments, the IC50 of this Lck inhibition was 2.6 μ M . In contrast, imatinib did not cause a reduction in the activating phosphorylations of Fyn and c-Src at concentrations as high as 50 μ M ( ). Thus, imatinib inhibits Lck, but not Fyn or Src, confirming the selectivity detected in the kinome screen. Cells were also treated with dasatinib that strongly inhibited all three Src kinases as expected ( ). Next, we determined whether imatinib and dasatinib bind to Lck directly, by making use of an Lck mutant with a substitution at the gatekeeper residue (T316) that would be expected to confer resistance to imatinib and dasatinib. Indeed, LckT316M/Y505F was not inhibited by imatinib ( ) or dasatinib ( ). To extend this finding, we investigated the effects of imatinib and dasatinib on the ubiquitination of Lck that is dependent on an active conformation of the kinase domain but not on kinase activity per se , as it also occurs for a kinase-deficient K273R/Y505F mutant. Both imatinib and dasatinib prevented ubiquitination of LckY505F, but had no effect on LckY505F/T316 M ( ). Together, these experiments show that imatinib and dasatinib bind to the ATP-binding site of Lck and freeze the kinase domain in an inactive conformation. Although the T-cell suppressive effects of imatinib and dasatinib have been attributed to Lck inhibition, paradoxically this was concluded from observed reductions in the inhibitory phosphorylation of Lck at Y505, which in fact indicates an enhanced Lck activity. To clarify the effect of these drugs on Lck in T cells, we measured the phosphorylation of Lck at"

The local continuous release of imatinib mesylate at the tumor site overcomes many obstacles associated with systemic delivery. Polymeric microspheres were prepared from various compositions of PLGA and loaded with imatinib mesylate. Imatinib release profiles, biological activity, and effect on PDGFR-B phosphorylation were confirmed in vitro. The therapeutic efficacy of imatinib microspheres was examined in two s.c. and orthotopic human glioblastoma xenograft models. A single local injection of PLGA microspheres loaded with a low concentration of imatinib mesylate led to 88% and 79% reduction in s.c. human (U87-MG) and murine (GL261) glioma tumors, respectively. PLGA-imatinib mesylate administered intracranially led to a 79% reduction in U87MG tumor volume. Immunohistochemical analysis showed a marked decrease in proliferation indices and tumor vessel density in the s.c. model and induction of apoptosis in an intracranial model. This is the first study to show the therapeutic efficacy of the local delivery of imatinib mesylate using a polymeric delivery system. \n Translational Relevance Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common primary brain tumor.

                    "Introduction Following decades during which gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) were not identified as an independent entity due to the lack of proper diagnostic tools, the groundbreaking discovery of the pivotal role of receptor tyrosine kinase KIT , both as molecular trigger and diagnostic marker in these tumors, allowed GISTs to be separated from smooth muscle tumors and other mesenchymal neoplasms. 1 Shortly after, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib proved to be dramatically active in a patient affected by unresectable metastatic GIST, 2 paving the way for the approval of this drug for treating GIST in record time. However, it was clear, within a short time, that not all GISTs respond to imatinib and that imatinib-responsive tumors eventually develop secondary resistance. In addition, over the years, GIST triggers alternative to KIT have been progressively discovered, and, increasingly, rare molecular defects are still being detected. 3 For these reasons, several drugs alternative to imatinib have been tested with the aim of overcoming imatinib resistance, either primary or secondary, in GIST (for reference, a list of drugs considered for the treatment of GIST, including their mechanisms of action, is presented in Table 1 ). However, coherent with the epoch of the studies, past GIST clinical trials often suffered from the lack of a proper"

                    "                            A Critical Review of Trials of First-Line BCR-ABL Inhibitor Treatment in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic Phase \n The characteristic expression of the constitutively active oncoprotein, BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was the basis for the development of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors for treatment. Three BCR-ABL inhibitors, imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for first-line treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase (CML-CP). This article reviews the key phase III clinical trials supporting the use of first-line imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib in patients with CML-CP as well as findings of supportive phase II studies. At the time of its approval in 2001, imatinib induced unprecedented response rates in patients with CML-CP; however, resistance and intolerance to imatinib prevent 20% to 30% of patients from deriving full therapeutic benefit. Nilotinib and dasatinib, both approved in 2010 for first-line CML-CP treatment, are more potent than imatinib and less susceptible to imatinib resistance mechanisms. Comparative clinical trials of each agent with imatinib have shown that they are associated with significantly deeper and more rapid responses than standard-dose imatinib, without compromising safety. Given that evidence suggests achievement of an early response is predictive of improved long-term outcomes, earlier use of these compounds may lead to more rapid, deeper responses corresponding with improvements in patient outcome. Although future studies will benefit from more uniform definitions of endpoints and methods of analysis, data from published studies of first-line BCR-ABL inhibitor treatment for patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP support the use of either dasatinib or nilotinib in place of imatinib. \n Introduction Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic malignancy caused by the protein product of the BCR-ABL fusion gene. In most cases, this fusion gene is generated by a balanced reciprocal translocation between band q34 of chromosome 9, which contains the Abelson ( ABL ) protooncogene, and band q11"

In this study, we have developed a novel culture model for CML acquired resistance in which a blast crisis CML cell line, KCL-22, underwent initial apoptosis upon treatment with therapeutically effective doses of imatinib, but cells re-grew after 2 weeks with development of resistance through T315I BCR-ABL mutation. We have found that pre-existing BCR-ABL mutations were not required for the resistance. We have shown that the acquired resistance of KCL-22 cells on imatinib was dependent on the expression of BCR-ABL itself and that the native BCR-ABL translocation locus plays a role in promoting BCR-ABL mutations. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture and Drugs CML cell lines KCL-22 and K562 were purchased from German Collection of Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany, and grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, SH30071.03).

However, our findings in human leukemia cells clearly differ from the previous studies in murine or guinea pig cells, which show that PI3K-Akt signaling causes translocation of BCRP without loss of overall protein expression. In summary, we find that BCRP confers resistance to imatinib in a Ph + CML cell line. Additionally we find that the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which is activated in K562 cells by BCR-ABL, controls total BCRP expression posttranscriptionally/translationally by a mechanism that is independent of the proteasome. Imatinib inhibition of BCR-ABL hence downregulates BCRP expression in BCR-ABL + cells. These observations may have profound implications for the treatment of CML, where it is likely that a BCR-ABL + stem-cell population analogous to normal hematopoietic SP cells exists, which expresses BCRP. Further studies of clinical cases of CML to determine the presence of such BCRP + CML cells is warranted, and if such cells do exist, it should be determined whether these cells are resistant to imatinib and whether imatinib downregulates their BCRP expression. Even if it is found that BCRP is downregulated by imatinib in clinical CML, it may be possible that the initial protection offered by BCRP will enable the cells to develop other mechanisms of resistance to imatinib, such as mutations of BCR-ABL, during the period that BCRP expression levels are declining. The protective effects of BCRP could be overcome by combining imatinib treatment with one of the many commercially available drugs that are BCRP inhibitors, which would also serve to enhance the bioavailability of imatinib by inhibition of BCRP expression in the intestine and bile canaliculi.

To elucidate the role of Bcr-Abl in TPO-induced aggregation of platelets from patients with CML-CP, we examined the effect of imatinib mesylate on the TPO-induced platelet aggregation. Imatinib mesylate dose-dependently inhibited the TPO-induced platelet aggregation ( Figure 5a ). The same concentrations of DMSO, a solvent of the inhibitor, used as a control did not affect the TPO-induced platelet aggregation (data not shown). Figure 5 Effects of PTK inhibitors on TPO-induced activation of CML-CP platelets. (a) PTK inhibitors dose-dependently inhibited TPO-induced aggregation of CML-CP platelets. Platelets were preincubated with various concentrations of PTK inhibitors (imatinib mesylate or AG490) at 37°C for 10 min before TPO treatment. After adding TPO (200 ng/ml), platelet aggregation was measured with a lumiaggregometer. The results are representative of three independent experiments. (b) Inhibitory effects of PTK inhibitors on PI3-kinase activity in CML-CP platelets. Platelets were incubated with each PTK inhibitor (5 μ M imatinib mesylate or 50 μ M AG490) at 37°C for 10 min. PI3-kinase activity in α PY immunoprecipitates was then assayed in vitro . PIP, phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate; Ori., origin. (c) Inhibitory effects of PTK inhibitors on TPO-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 in CML-CP platelets. Platelets were preincubated with each PTK inhibitor (5 μ M imatinib mesylate or 50 μ M AG490) at 37°C for 10 min before treatment with TPO (200 ng/ml). Then the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Jak2 antibody or normal rabbit serum as a control, followed by immunoblot analysis using α PY antibody (4G10) (upper panel).

This medicine was discovered by Novartis and developed in collaboration with Speedel.   Tasigna was launched during the fourth quarter of 2007 in the US and Europe following regulatory approvals as a new therapy for patients with a certain form of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who are resistant or intolerant to treatment with Gleevec/Glivec (imatinib). Tasigna is now approved in about 40 countries, and was also submitted for approval in Japan in June. Tasigna and Gleevec/Glivec both inhibit Bcr-Abl, the cause of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML). Tasigna was designed to be a more potent and selective inhibitor of Bcr-Abl and its mutations. Separate Phase III studies are underway comparing Tasigna and Gleevec/Glivec in newly diagnosed CML patients as well as those with sub-optimal responses to previous therapy.

BCR-ABL is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase and plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of CML. Imatinib mesylate, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is effective in CML, but drug resistance and relapse occur. The coiled-coil (CC) domain located in BCR(1-72) mediates BCR-ABL tetramerization, which is essential for the activation of tyrosine kinase and transformation potential of BCR-ABL. CC domain is supposed to be a therapeutic target for CML. We purified a TAT-CC protein competively binding with the endogenous CC domain to reduce BCR-ABL kinase activity. We found that TAT-CC co-located and interacted with BCR-ABL in Ba/F3-p210 and K562 cells. It induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in these cells. It increased the sensitivity of these cells to imatinib and reduced the phosphorylation of BCR-ABL, CRKL and STAT5. We confirmed that TAT-CC could attenuate the oncogenicity of Ba/F3-p210 cells and diminish the volume of K562 solid tumor in mice. We conclude targeting the CC may provide a complementary therapy to inhibit BCR-ABL oncogenicity. \n          "

Study design A prospective, non-randomized, and single center trial was conducted to evaluate the role of Glivec in inducing objec-tive response in GIST patients. Patients were administered 400 mg of Glivec in 100-mg capsules, taken orally daily with food. Patients had regular physical examinations and evaluations of performance status, body weight, complete blood count, and serum chemistry. The administration of each dose and any adverse events were recorded for each patient. Standard computed tomography (CT) was performed on each patient every three months to assess patient response. Standard [18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron-emission tomography (PET) scanning was performed on selected patients to complement standard CT and assess changes in the metabolic profiles of the tumors. Efficacy and safety evaluation The response of the tumor to Glivec was evaluated aft-er one month, three months, and every three months thereafter or whenever medical need was indicated. Ass-essments were performed according to the standard Sou-thwest Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria and based solely on CT or PET[ 17 ].

The reparative effect of different SV preparations on LPS‐induced endothelial injury was mediated by PDGFRβ/PDGF‐BB Based on our Western blotting and cytotoxicity titration assay results (Figure S4 A), we used 20 μmol/L imatinib, an inhibitor of PFGFRβ, to investigate the changes in barrier protection by SV in the presence or absence of PDGFRβ phosphorylation. Both the Transwell‐EB monolayer permeability assay and TEER measurements showed that the barrier function of the SV/SV‐NP + imatinib groups was significantly decreased compared with those of the SV/SV‐NP groups (Figure (Figure6A‐C). 6 A‐C). A wound healing assay showed that the cell migration capacity of the SV/SV‐NP + imatinib groups was decreased compared with those of the SV/SV‐NP groups (Figure (Figure6D,E). 6 D,E). Western blot analysis showed that the level of IQGAP1 protein in SV/SV‐NP + imatinib groups was significantly down‐regulated compared with those of SV/SV‐NP groups (Figure (Figure6F,I). 6 F,I). Similarly, Western blotting and ELISAs showed that the ratio of phosphorylated Akt to Akt protein and PDGF‐BB in supernatants of cultures in the SV/SV‐NP + imatinib groups was remarkably down‐regulated compared with the SV/SV‐NP groups (Figure (Figure6F,H,J). 6 F,H,J). The ratio of phosphorylated PDGFRβ to PDGFRβ was also inhibited by imatinib (Figure (Figure6F,G). 6 F,G).

The structural similarities between them and the inhibitors of ABL1 tyrosine kinase such as imatinib prompted us to evaluate its activity in this area.

For the leukemia model, two bone marrow components were incorporated with liver tissue to measure the cytostatic effects of two anticancer drugs -- diclofenac and imatinib -- on bone marrow-derived cells and off-target effects on the liver. Testing showed that liver viability was not affected by imatinib, but was reduced by 30% with diclofenac.

In this work, the authors used Cell Biosciences cIEF assays to quantify levels of MYC oncoprotein and B-cell lymphoma protein-2 (BCL2) in lymphoma samples and to characterize the effects of imatinib treatment on the activation of ERK1/2, MEK1, STAT3, STAT5, JNK and caspase 3 in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. The authors report using only 4 nanoliters of tissue lysate per assay. In summary, the Cell Biosciences CB1000 system provides a unique view of cell signaling processes in extremely small biological samples."

The remaining eight miRNAs were not significantly different between the two groups (data not shown). Given that GISTs harbouring double KIT mutations or wild-type KIT and PDGFRA are known mechanisms of imatinib resistance, we performed an independent evaluation of the samples harbouring only a single KIT mutation (all in exon 11). We showed that expression levels of miR-125a-5p (4.7-folds; P =0.029; t -test), miR-107 (4.1-folds; P =0.031), miR-134 (38.1-folds; P =0.015), miR-301a-3p (4.4-folds; P =0.044) and miR-365 (4.2-folds; P =0.05) were significantly"

                    "USA). Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of phosphate from ATP to tyrosine residues in polypeptides. The human genome contains about 90 functional PTKs that regulate cellular proliferation, survival, differentiation and motility. Many members of the PTK family have been identified as oncogenes over the last 25 years. More recently, inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity has become an important new route to treat cancer. Imatinib (Gleevec) is a very effective drug to treat patients with Philadelphia-chromosome (Ph) positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); imatinib inhibits the constitutive tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL, the gene product encoded by the bcr-abl fusion gene, a result of the Ph translocation. Imatinib is also effective as a treatment for gastro-intestinal tumors (GIST). The underlying mechanism is that GISTs are often the result of overactivation of the receptor tyrosine kinases cKIT or PDGFRalpha, both of which are also inhibited by imatinib. However, a significant problem associated with imatinib treatment is the occurrence of resistance upon prolonged treatment, both in CML and in GIST. Two other approved molecules, erlotinib (Tarceva) and gefitinib (Iressa), are tyrosine kinase inhibitors primarily targeted at the EGFR receptor. The clinical efficacy of erlotinib and gefitinib is by far not as impressive as imatinib: the response rate of erlotinib and gefitinib in an unselected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient population is between 10 and 20%. In addition, acquired resistance occurs frequently and rapidly during treatment with EGFR inhibitors. Hence, the early detection of emerging resistance during treatment, and the stratification of drug-naïve patients that"

Pharmaceutical companies have had to accept that Gleevec, a drug that treats a form of leukaemia by targeting a specific gene product, is almost certainly going to be a rare exception in the therapeutic arsenal; most cancers are far too complex to yield to such a magic bullet.

These results are consistent with the reported immunosuppressive effects of STI571/imatinib treatment in some CML patients. A subset of CML patients receiving standard imatinib therapy develop varicella zoster virus infection as a consequence of reactivation of latent viral infection ( 109 ). This effect is likely due to defects in cell-mediated immunity as a result of low numbers of CD4 + T cells ( 109 ). The availability of mouse models lacking Abl family"

Upon return of more favorable conditions due to ARHI suppression, as observed in clinical ovarian carcinoma, the tumor regains proliferative potential and led to rapid re-growth. A more convincing demonstration of autophagy as a survival pathway in quiescent cells comes from studies of GIST, the first solid tumor to be treated successfully with the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) ( Gupta et al., 2010 ). However, less than 5% of GISTs regress significantly upon Gleevac treatment; rather, in the vast majority of patients, tumor cells indefinitely remain in a dormant, quiescent state in the presence of imatinib. Recent work indicates that this dormant state, termed stable disease, is closely associated with the induction of autophagy in response to imatinib. Upon inhibiting autophagy using RNAi-mediated ATG depletion or antimalarials such as quinacrine, GIST cells undergo high levels of apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, autophagy appears critical for the establishment of a dormant state in which GIST cells can survive indefinitely ( Gupta et al., 2010 ). Moreover,"

Nilotinib was potent as imatinib in inducing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation of EOL-1 cells, with IC(50) values of 0.54 nM. In addition, both imatinib and nilotinib inhibited the phosphorylation of PDGFR-alpha tyrosine kinase with equivalent efficacy ( Verstovsek et al 2006b ).

In the apo form the α C-helix, the A-loop and other functionally relevant motifs undergo significant conformational changes on time scales spanning the μ s-ms range. MD simulations show different conformations of the α C helix, in agreement with the α C-in and α C-out conformations captured in different crystal structures 35 . The conformational landscape of the α C-helix is altered by the binding of Imatinib, as proven by the computed free energy landscape and the appearance of most missing signals in the NMR spectra. On the contrary, the signals corresponding to the A-loop are not visible neither in the spectra of the apo nor of the ligand-bound forms due to conformational heterogeneity. However, the conformations spanned by the apo and bound forms are different. Simulations 18 , 19 and crystal structures 47 , 48 hint to an equilibrium between the active and inactive forms. When Imatinib is bound, steric hindrance prevents the A-loop from assuming a fully extended active form. Indeed, the simulations predict an equilibrium between closed and semi-closed A-loop conformations. The computed binding ΔG is in good agreement with the experiment. The free energy calculations of the DFG-in to DFG-out conformational change in presence of Imatinib show that Imatinib can approach the site irrespective of the DFG conformation. The main association path involves a conformational selection, with a small induced-fit effect, predicted to be . The balance between the two might change at different temperatures due to the different entropic/enthalpic balance. The induced fit effect is also in agreement"

Consistent with the enhanced growth of SMCs seeded in the presence of PHD2 +/− macrophages, conditioned medium from PHD2 +/− macrophages reduced the expression level of calponin-1, SM22α, smoothelin, NmMHC and αSMA, therefore, supporting a proliferative phenotype ( FIG. 8 , Panels F-J). Unlike what we observed in the migration assays, AMD3100 or imatinib alone abrogated the increased SMC growth by PHD2 +/− macrophages. The combination of both AMD3100 and imatinib did not elicit an additive effect ( FIG. 8 , Panel K). Similarly, either single or double knock-down of SDF1 and PDGFB in PHD2 +/− macrophages hindered SMC growth (data not shown). Prompted by the in vitro results, we treated WT→WT and HE→WT mice with daily administration of AMD3100 (5 mg/kg) or imatinib (50 mg/kg), alone or in combination. In vivo, each drug alone only partially prevented the increased foiination of second generation collateral branches in HE→WT mice ( FIG. 8 , Panel L), while third generation collaterals were affected by either treatment alone ( FIG. 8 , Panel M). However, the combination of AMD3100 and imatinib more potently prevented collateralization in the adductor of these mice. In WT→WT mice, the number of collateral branch arteries was not affected in all conditions tested ( FIG. 8 , Panels L and M). Thus, in mice with reduced levels of myeloid PHD2, combined PDGFB and SDF1 pathway activation is"

Using the KAT-4 thyroid carcinoma model, which has known PDGF paracrine signaling properties, Pietras et al. demonstrated that KAT-4 tumors expressed PDGF β-receptors in the stroma and that PDGF-B bound KAT-4 cells in vitro. Next, Pietras et al. used the tyrosine kinase inhibiting drug STI571 (GLEEVEC™) to block PDGF-B signaling in KAT-4 tumors and showed that this treatment significantly decreased tumor IFP in vivo leading to increased uptake of taxol. However, since STI571 targets both PDGF α and B3 receptors, as well as Kit, Abl, and Arg tyrosine kinases, it was impossible to know if the effect of STI571 was due to PDGF-B blockage alone. This ambiguity was solved by using a highly specific aptamer to block PDGF-B in similar experiments. The aptamer has an affinity of 100 pM for PDGF-B and no appreciable affinity for the PDGF-A sequence. As with STI571, treatment of KAT-4 xenograft mice with PEG-conjugated PDGF-B aptamer lowered IFP and dramatically increased tumor uptake of taxol. Most importantly, aptamer treatment strongly enhanced taxol's ability to inhibit tumor growth. In addition, a currently marketed cancer therapeutic, the PDGF-receptor antagonist GLEEVEC™ has been shown to be effective at reducing tumor IFP and increasing the tumor uptake of cytotoxins when used in combination with a cytotoxin such as taxol. Thus, the methods and materials of the present are used to inhibit the biological activity of PDGF-B and its etiology in tumor development"

Biomarker-Based Drug Development Is a Proven, Successful Strategy in the Development of Novel Anticancer Drugs There are now multiple examples of biomarkers providing key rationale and end points in the development of successful molecular targeted agents; also, there are many examples in which further mechanistic insight is required to fully exploit important new therapeutic approaches, including the following examples. Imatinib. This molecular targeted agent is highly efficacious in two malignancies (CML and gastrointestinal stromal tumor) that are difficult to treat with conventional modalities. The well-established BCR-ABL translocation in CML provided a biomarker and a therapeutic target for this rationally designed small molecule. In clinical trials of imatinib, assessment of biomarker-based responses ( i.e. , molecular as well as hematological remissions) facilitated proof of clinical benefit in CML and is now used in clinical decision-making. c-KIT expression provided a rationale for use of imatinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and clinical trials showed substantial anticancer effect. Additional studies indicating differential activity of imatinib based on particular Kit mutations suggest that biomarker-based patient selection may be useful for imatinib therapy. Trastuzumab. This humanized MAb was derived based on the oncogenic role of HER2, including studies showing frequent amplification and overexpression of HER2 in breast cancer and the role of HER2 as negative prognostic factor. Clinical development of trastuzumab initially focused on HER2-overexpressing breast cancer patients because this phenotype was"

                    "3 Results and discussion 3.1 PDGFR expression We first examined non‐phosphorylated and phosphorylated PDGFR‐β, PDGFR‐α and c‐kit expression in both wt and resistant SLK cells by Western blotting and flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1 A, both wt ‐SLK and SLK–DOX cells expressed the PDGF receptors, whilst c‐kit was barely detectable. Ligand‐induced phosphorylation of PDGFR‐β, PDGFR‐α and c‐kit was inhibited to background levels in cells treated with imatinib without affecting the expression levels of the receptors. A high expression of β‐subtype non‐phosphorylated receptor as detected by flow cytometry is also shown in Fig. 1 B. Since it was suggested that inhibition of PDGFR phosphorylation is associated with apoptosis induction [ 16 ] , experiments were carried out in order to verify if imatinib induced apoptosis and the mechanism involved. 3.2 Apoptosis and cell growth evaluation In order to verify if imatinib could induce apoptosis, we exposed both SLK cell lines to different concentrations of imatinib (15, 25, 35 μM for 48 h). As shown in Fig. 2 A, imatinib was able to induce apoptosis in a dose dependent manner in both cell lines. In Fig. 2 B the typical sign of apoptosis, i.e. chromatin condensation, is shown. Moreover, considering that the plasma steady state levels of imatinib observed in treated patients correspond to values between 3 and 10 μM [ 17 ] , we focused our attention on the effects induced by imatinib at 15 μM on both wt and resistant SLK cells. In particular, as reported in Fig. 3 A, a significantly decreased cell grow was detected after 15 μM imatinib exposure in both wt and SLK–DOX cells. Hence, imatinib was capable of impairing cell growth and to induce apoptosis in both wt and MDR‐KS cells. 3.3 Bcl‐2 expression We then analyzed the expression of Bcl‐2, an integral membrane protein mainly located on the outer membrane of mitochondria. Its overexpression prevents cells from undergoing apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli [ 18 ] . In our experiments, a quantification of this protein was carried out in both wt and resistant SLK cells. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the expression of this protein decreased significantly 24 and 48 h after imatinib treatment in both cell lines. 3.4 Caspase activity Apoptosis occurs through two main pathways. The first, referred to as the extrinsic or cytoplasmic pathway, is triggered through the death receptors. The second is the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway that, when stimulated, leads to the release of cytochrome c from the"

CML stem cell survival Deregulation of programmed cell death or apoptosis allows cancer stem cells to propagate even as they detach from the niche and accumulate genetic mutations. In CML, resistance to apoptosis begins with BCR-ABL, and notably, the final consequence of BCR-ABL inhibition with imatinib is induction of apoptosis. 66 CML stem cell resistance to apoptosis involves the aberrant expression of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis-regulatory proteins including anti-apoptotic members such as Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and pro-apoptotic members such as Bad and Bim. 67 – 82 The anti-apoptotic members inhibit mitochondrial release of cytochrome c"

Metastatic cancer cells resist the effects of chemotherapeutic agents by upregulating drug transporters, which efflux the drugs, and by activating proliferation and survival signaling pathways. Previously, we found that c-Abl and Arg non-receptor tyrosine kinases are activated in breast cancer, melanoma, and glioblastoma cells, and promote cancer progression. In this report, we demonstrate that the c-Abl/Arg inhibitor, imatinib (imatinib mesylate, STI571, Gleevec), reverses intrinsic and acquired resistance to the anthracycline, doxorubicin, by inducing G2/M arrest and promoting apoptosis in cancer cells expressing highly active c-Abl and Arg. Significantly, imatinib prevents intrinsic resistance by promoting doxorubicin-mediated NF-κB/p65 nuclear localization and repression of NF-κB targets in a STAT3-dependent manner, and by preventing activation of a novel STAT3/HSP27/p38/Akt survival pathway. In contrast, imatinib prevents acquired resistance by inhibiting upregulation of the ABC drug transporter, ABCB1, directly inhibiting ABCB1 function, and abrogating survival signaling. Thus, imatinib inhibits multiple novel chemoresistance pathways, which indicates that it may be effective in reversing intrinsic and acquired resistance in cancers containing highly active c-Abl and Arg, a critical step in effectively treating metastatic disease. Furthermore, since imatinib converts a master survival regulator, NF-κB, from a pro-survival into a pro-apoptotic factor, our data suggest that NF-κB inhibitors may be ineffective in sensitizing tumors containing activated c-Abl/Arg to anthracyclines, and instead might antagonize anthracycline-induced apoptosis. \n Associated Data Supplementary Materials Figure S1: Genetic analysis of the BT-549 cell line."

Although high expression of PDGFRβ has been reported in HCC patients, growing evidence has indicated that the aberrant expression and activity of PDGFRα are more closely associated with the pathogenesis of HCC, indicating that the inhibition of PDGFRα may represent a new potential therapeutic strategy for HCC 8 , 9 . As the first rationally designed TKI, imatinib has revolutionized the therapy of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) by inhibiting BCR-ABL1 kinase and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) by acting the mutations of c-KIT 10 . Meanwhile, in GIST patients without c-KIT mutations, imatinib also showed activity to inhibit PDGFRa 11 . In a previous attempt to compare different chemotypes, we found that substitution of the 2phenylaminopyrimidine core of imatinib with 2-phenyloxypyrimidine abolished the inhibition to most kinases, while preserved the inhibitory activity to PDGFRα 12 , suggesting that 2-phenyloxypyrimidine core can be explored as a scaffold for the design of next generation of selective PDGFRα inhibitors.

The patient had GC in hepatic lesions but GP in mesenteric lesions. Thus, evaluation of the tumor response should be analyzed on a lesion by lesion basis. The present study had several limitations. First, a small number of patients were enrolled. Second, the follow-up duration after imatinib treatment was uneven (range 1-6 mo), due to lack of certain protocol criteria for imaging follow up. Third, there was no gold standard reference (such as surgical pathology after imatinib treatment or FDG-PET scan) for evaluation of tumor response. In conclusion, various patterns of CT changes for evaluation the tumor response were presented which might determine disease prognosis. A combination of RECIST criteria and patterns of CT change have been proposed for better response evaluation in GISTs. The early detection of focal solid or new solid lesions after maximal dose of imatinib mesylate suggests disease progression and might be helpful in early intervention such as surgery or new tyrosine kinase inhibitors. COMMENTS Background For optimal clinical outcome, the accurate assessment of tumor response to any treatments is important. RECIST criteria have commonly been used to assess response in solid tumors for decades. The"

Briefly, patients underwent a 60-min uptake phase, a 5-min emission scan, and a 3-min transmission scan per field of view in a two-dimensional mode. Images were interpreted using volumetric and multiple orthogonal projection analysis then quantitated using vendor specific software. Maximal standardized uptake value (SUV max ) was measured from a region of interest (ROI) representative of tumor on pretreatment images and corresponding ROIs on posttreatment images. Since there is no standardized criteria for PET response at 3, 5, or 7 days after initiation of imatinib for GIST, PET response was defined as either a residual SUV max ≤ 3.9 in post-imatinib scans or a relative 40% decrease in SUV max between pre and post-imatinib scans. 15 Dynamic (Perfusion) Computed Tomography (dCT) dCT was performed before and after preoperative imatinib (within 24 h of surgical resection).

Although TBI-containing conditioning seems to be more toxic as compared to its busulfan-containing counterpart, the speed of engraftment, event-free survival and relapse rate are not significantly different ( Clift et al, 1994 ). We hypothesise that in the autologous ( Pigneux et al, 1999 ) and possibly in the allogeneic transplantation setting TBI/cyclophosphamide + imatinib based on their synergistic effects could produce superior disease-free survival, even though risks and benefits should be thoroughly evaluated in future clinical trials. Treosulfan is employed alternatively to busulfan in conditioning regimens ( Casper et al, 2000 ) and could also be supplemented with imatinib in CML patients. As a next step of preclinical testing, these combinations can be assessed in a ‘mock-conditioning’ scenario, i.e. in a mixed population of BCR–ABL-positive and -negative cells. In conclusion, this is the first report on synergistic interaction between imatinib and γ-irradiation. It highlights the potential of combination treatment of CML employing specific BCR–ABL tyrosine kinase targeting and provides a rationale for the design of future conditioning protocols for stem cell transplantation in CML.

Examples of such phenomena can include chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) where the drug imatinib targets a mutated protein originating from the fusion of two proteins (BCR and ABL), breast cancer with amplification or mutation of the HER2 (ErbB2) receptor targeted with the drug trastuzumab, lung cancer with mutations in the EGFR or ALK kinases, targeted with drugs such as erlotiniv/afatinib, and crizotinib, and several"

The choice of the target transcripts was based on the common assumption that transcripts induced in response to a stress are more likely to represent biologically-relevant components of cellular machinery responsible for coping with that stress. We have chosen 3 anticancer drugs — etoposide (inhibitor of topoisomerase type II) , mirin (inhibitor of the DNA double-strand sensing protein MRE11A) and imatinib (inhibitor of the BCR-ABL oncogene present in K562) — as the survival challenge treatments for this work. Imatinib has been widely used to treat BCR-ABL positive CML in clinic while etoposide has been used to treat a variety of cancers including leukemia in certain clinical settings . On the other hand, although mirin is not used clinically, it was found to consistently induce a large number of vlincRNAs"

Discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy and donor lymphocyte infusions have shown little efficacy in ALL. Administration of ABL-directed TKI to prevent relapse and re-establish molecular negativity in patients who remain or become PCR positive after SCT therefore is conceptually attractive. We hypothesized that molecular responses and overall treatment outcome could be improved by starting imatinib early after SCT, when the leukemic cell burden is likely to be low. The clinical consequences of starting imatinib during the early post-transplant period have not yet been systematically studied. Available data are limited mostly to few case reports and small retrospectively analyzed series with only two prospective studies published to date. The current randomized study was designed to compare two interventional strategies, in which imatinib was given either prophylactically as soon as clinically feasible, or minimal residual disease (MRD) triggered following the first detection of BCR–ABL1 transcripts. Patients Patients ( ⩾ 18 years) with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL or lymphoid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia who received an allogeneic SCT while in CR were eligible.

Criteria for starting imatinib included sufficient recovery of absolute neutrophil count ( ⩾ × 10 9 /l) and platelet ( ⩾ 50 × 10 9 /l) counts, absence of uncontrolled graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) or infections, ECOG performance status 0–2 and adequate organ function.

Different role of PKCδ in each cellular line. \n The c-kit inhibitor STI571 represents one of the most important treatments for patients with mastocytosis. However, intracellular pathways modulated by this compound are not completely defined. Here, STI571 effect on Protein Kinase C (PKC) regulation is determined in HMC-1 mast cell lines. STI571 activates PKCδ isoform resulting in HMC-1(560) apoptosis. The apoptosis observed is PKCδ-dependent, since PKCδ-silencing avoids STI571 effect. c-kit inhibition implies nuclear PKCδ translocation characterized by a clear dependence on actin cytoskeleton integrity in HMC-1(560) cell line, but not in HMC-1(560,816). Therefore, PKCδ modulations can lead to a serious decrease in STI571 treatment-effectiveness. \n                               \n                                                                "

This st udy included 5 patients with aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM) treated with 100 mg to 400 mg of Gleevec daily. These 5 patients ranged from 49 to 74 years of age. In addition to these 5 patients, 10 published case reports and case series describe the use of Gleevec in 23 additional patients with ASM aged 26 to 85 years who also received 100 mg to 400 mg of Gleevec daily. Cytogenetic abnormalities were evaluated in 20 of the 28 ASM patients treated with Gleevec from the published reports and in the phase 2 study. Seven of these 20 patients had the FIP1L1- deletion). Patients with this cytogenetic abnormality were predominantly males and had eosinophilia associated with their systemic mast cell disease. Two patients had a Ki t mutation in the juxtamembrane region (one Phe522Cys and one K509I) and four patients had a D816V c-Kit mutation (not considered sensitive to Gleevec), one with concomitant CML. Of the 28 patients treated for ASM, 8 (29%) achieved a complete hematologic response and 9 (32%) a partial hematologic response (61% overall response rate). Median duration of Gleevec therapy for the 5 ASM patients in the phase 2 study was 13 months (range 1.4-22.3 months) and between 1 month and more than 30 months in the responding patients described in the published medical literature.

The median follow-up for patients without a RFS event was 42 months. There were 84 (42%) RFS events in the month treatment arm and 50 (25%) RFS events in the 36- month treatment arm. Thirty -six months of Gleevec Reference ID: 3250515 treatment significantly prolonged RFS compared to 12 months of Gleevec treatment with a hazard ratio of 0.46 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.65), p\u003c0.0001 (Figure 4). The median follow- up for overall survival (OS) in patients still li ving was 48 months. There were 25 (13%) deaths in the 12-month treatment arm and 12 (6%) deaths in the 36- month treatment arm. Thirty -six months of Gleevec treatment significantly prolonged OS compared to 12 months of Gleevec treatment with a hazard ratio of 0.45 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.89), p=0.0187 ( Figure 5 ).

The right hand panel shows that in the presence of the PI3 kinase inhibitor GDC0941, P-Akt is not phosphorylated, and the kinetics of ERK and S6 phosphorylation are delayed, compared to the control cells treated with LPS alone (left hand panel). It is further shown that PI3K inhibition has no impact on the proteasomal degradation of IκBα. FIG. 10 shows the effect of exposing cells to GLEEVEC™ (imatinib, or STI571), the details of which are provided in Example 7. As can be seen from the figure, treatment of K562 cells for 30 min with 2 μM results in \u003e95% inhibition of the phosphorylation of the downstream STAT5 target. Phosphorylated STAT5 acts as a transcriptional activator of several target proteins, including Cyclin D, and constitutive expression of Cyclin D maintains K562 cells in cell cycle. As can be seen in the Figure, although the phosphorylation of STAT5 is inhibited after 30 min imatinib exposure (as demonstrated by a shift in the total population of cells that are P-Stat5 positive from above the threshold line to below the threshold line in GLEEVBC-treated cells), there is no concomitant change in the cell cycle, as measured by DNA content (see inset).

It stimulated the search for novel molecules for treatment of imatinib-resistance CML. Inhibiting the amplification of Bcr/Abl oncogene is believed to be a new effective strategy to override the imatinib resistance on CML cells. In present research, we demonstrated that dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a safe and effective antimalarial analog of artemisinin, could significantly inhibit the Bcr/Abl fusion gene at the mRNA level in CML cells sensitive or resistant to imatinib (including the primary CML cells with T315I mutation) and induce cell death. Moreover, dihydroartemisinin could also lead to the inhibition of the Bcr/Abl protein expression and tyrosine kinase activity, and strongly suppress on the downstream signals of Bcr/Abl, which included inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity of AKT and ERK, promotion"

The prevalence of CML in the US is estimated at over 20,000. This figure is expected to grow significantly as the recent approval of Bcr-Abl inhibitors has increased survival by many years. The most common first line treatment of CML is imatinib mesylate. Even with this powerful new agent, imatinib mesylate resistant and refractory patients occur at a rate of 4-13% of the treated population per year. Imatinib resistance is due in part to Bcr-Abl amplification, Bcr-Abl point mutations and upregulation of other kinases that bypass Bcr-Abl including Lyn kinase.

                    "AXL is known to regulate the same signaling pathways as KIT, but the mechanism of its regulation in GIST is unknown. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) may play a role in the survival of imatinib-resistant cells, as well. Sakurama and colleagues showed that an imatinib-resistant cell line with the KIT D820Y mutation maintained FAK and AKT activity, whereas in an imatinib-sensitive cell line with a KIT exon 11 mutation imatinib suppressed FAK and AKT activity. Inhibition of FAK activity with an inhibitor resulted in cell death in vitro and in mouse xenografts with the KIT D820Y mutation ( 56 ). IGF1R amplification may represent another mechanism of imatinib resistance. It is overexpressed in GISTs lacking KIT and PDGFRA activating mutations and in pediatric GISTs, and its inhibition in GIST cell lines results in cell death regardless of KIT mutation status ( 57 58 ). In both CML and GIST, there is emerging evidence that patients with trough imatinib levels of \u003c1,000 to 1,200 ng/ml may have inferior outcomes compared with patients with higher trough levels. Notably, in a phase II study of imatinib for metastatic GIST, the median time to progression was 11.3 months for patients in the lowest plasma trough quartile (\u003c1,110 ng/mL) compared with more than 30 months for patients with trough drug levels in the higher quartiles ( P = 0.0029; ref. 59 ). Imatinib blood level testing is now clinically available and may be useful in optimizing imatinib dosing for individual patients. This strategy will be tested in upcoming clinical studies to optimize tumor response and attempt to delay the emergence of clinical drug resistance. Treatment of patients with imatinib-resistant GIST There are an increasing number of options for the management of progressive disease. If a patient manifests global or widespread progression on imatinib, it is recommended that he or she continue kinase inhibition by increasing imatinib dose as tolerated ( 60 ). Notably, in the S0033 phase III study, 33% of patients who progressed on 400 mg and crossed over to 800 mg achieved responses and/or stable disease ( 29 ). Dose escalation may overcome resistance resulting from decreased imatinib binding affinity (as seen in vitro with exon 9 mutations or secondary mutations), KIT amplification, or lower plasma drug levels from altered pharmacokinetics ( 43 48 59 ). For patients in whom a dose increase is ineffective or not tolerated, imatinib should be discontinued and sunitinib should be started. Targeted Therapy of GIST with Sunitinib Sunitinib is an inhibitor of KIT, PDGFRs, VEGFR-1, 2, 3, FLT3, and RET. After sunitinib activity was shown in phase I and/or II clinical trials ( 61 62 ), a phase III placebo-controlled trial was done"

The change in mean fluorescence intensity (∆MFI) refers to MFI of CD107a + NK cells with target (K562) minus MFI of CD107a + NK cells without target. Mean, 95% confidence intervals, and significance (* p \u003c 0.05, ** p \u003c 0.01) are shown. We extended the analysis to PBMCs from three adult and two pediatric patients receiving imatinib for CML. CML NK cells and monocytes displayed a higher CXCR4 surface expression as compared with healthy donors ( Fig. 7B , Supplemental Fig. 4B ). The chemokine receptor surface density further increased when CML PBMCs were treated in vitro with imatinib at the concentration of 6 μg/ml ( Fig. 7B , Supplemental Fig. 4B ). Moreover, the treatment downregulated the expression of CCR1 and M-CSFR in monocytes ( Fig. 7C , Supplemental Fig. 4B ). Unlike what was observed in healthy donors (see Fig. 2A , Supplemental Fig. 1C ), in vitro imatinib exposure did not decrease the expression of CXCR3 in CML NK cells ( Supplemental Fig. 4B ). NK cells of CML patients were also analyzed for degranulation in the presence of the prototypical K562 target cell line ( Fig. 7D , Supplemental Fig. 4C ). The degranulation capability of resting NK cells did not significantly differ from that of healthy donors. Moreover, the in vitro treatment with imatinib did not affect the degranulation capability of resting and cytokine-stimulated CML NK cells. Notably, in some patients NK cells appeared to degranulate better in the presence than in the absence of the drug. Discussion More than 20 TKIs are approved as cancer therapies for patients with Ph+ hematological malignancies, melanoma, breast cancer, non–small cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. Recently it has been demonstrated that imatinib provides clinical benefits in GISTs ( 18 ) and NB ( 15 ). In particular, in GISTs, benefits were associated with drug-dependent off-target effects, such as modulation of immune responses, and in NB a similar mechanism was postulated to occur. This prompted us to analyze the effect of two TKIs, namely imatinib and nilotinib, on NK cells, which represent pivotal cytolytic effectors in antitumor responses. Moreover, owing to the existence of a crosstalk between NK cells and macrophages ( 34 ), the analysis was extended to monocytes and macrophages, with particular attention to those characterized by tumor-promoting M2 polarization. TKI concentrations ≥15 μg/ml are higher than those achievable in adult patients in which plasma concentrations between 1 and 3 μg/ml are presently recommended ( 1 ). In pediatric patients, who showed higher tolerability than adults, plasma concentrations of imatinib ranged from 2 to 7 μg/ml, with lower values associated with better responses ( 15 ). We thus selected drug concentrations ≤6 μg/ml that, under our experimental conditions, were devoid of direct effects on NB cells and we analyzed their influence on phenotype and function of immune cells. PB (resting) NK cells were highly resistant to the cytotoxic effect of the drugs, as \u003c10% of cells died when exposed to imatinib and virtually all survived when exposed to nilotinib. Moreover, with the exception of nilotinib used at 6 μg/ml, NK cells maintained the ability to be activated by immunostimulatory cytokines, increasing the expression of activation markers and acquiring a degranulation capability in the presence of NB cells, comparable to that detected"

NR = not reported Should all newly diagnosed patients be treated with a second generation inhibitor? Given the association between CCyR on imatinib and EFS and OS, it is hard to refute the logic of minimizing progression risk by reducing leukemia burden faster and more profoundly. One important factor is that the tolerability of the newer agents is at least comparable to that of imatinib. However, differences in OS have yet to be observed, albeit with limited follow-up. Another concern in both studies is that approximately 20% of patients had dropped out from the experimental arms for a variety of reasons. Additionally, EFS on imatinib is excellent in patients with low risk according to Sokal or Hasford score, suggesting that these patients may be safely managed with the less expensive drug, an issue that will become even more important once generic imatinib becomes available (likely in 2015). One would predict that the clinical importance of accurate molecular prognostication tools, such as gene expression profiling, will increase proportionately to the price difference between alternative therapeutic options [ 17 ]. Which parameters will guide the selection of dasatinib or nilotinib in newly diagnosed patients?"

Dr. Schneider and colleagues have worked to characterize the structural features that may switch the binding properties of compounds from fast binding to slow binding kinetics and extend residence times for the CycC/CDK8 complex, a potent oncogene that is involved in transcriptional activity and epigenetic processes. Small molecule inhibitors, including BAY-43006 and imatinib, bind to the deep pockets of kinases (adjacent to the ATP binding site), and their residence time is extended if the DMG (Asp-Met-Gly) motif near the target kinase’s activation loop is maintained in an “out” conformation.

FIG. 6 shows low density lipoprotein binding (LDL) capacity of proteoglycans secreted by human vascular smooth muscle cells stimulated by PDGF in the presence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with different effects on GAG length. Total proteoglycans were isolated and purified from control cells or PDGF stimulated cells treated with imatinib or genistein and applied to individual LDL affinity columns prepared by protecting proteoglycan binding sites with heparin. Data shows the total bound proteoglycans which were released from the affinity columns by 1M NaCl. FIG. 7 shows a scheme showing the pathways of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells and the novel pathway controlling glycosaminoglycan (GAG) length of proteoglycans. Imatinib inhibits both PDGF receptor and c-Abl tyrosine kinases whereas genistein inhibits only PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase. c-Abl is central to the pathway of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) elongation on proteoglycans and hence inhibition of c-Abl represents a target for reduction in GAG size and reduces lipoprotein binding (see FIG. 6 ).

                    "Example 10 LDL Binding Properties of Proteoglycans Produced by Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells in which cAbl is Inhibited. The premise of the present application is that the proteoglycans produced in vascular smooth muscle cells stimulated by atherogenic growth factors (such as PDGF) will show enhanced binding to human LDL and that this will be prevented or reversed if the cells are treated with inhibitors of cAbl such as imatinib. A new approach to these studies is now used in which the proteoglycan core proteins are metabolically radio-labelled and used to study the binding of human LDL. Cells are incubated with Translabel® (ICN Biochemicals) ( 35 S-methioinine and cysteine amino acids) and the amino acids are incorporated into the core"

A blood test performed for pain in the upper left side of the abdomen had showed leukocytosis. At the admission the patient was apyretic, with no systemic signs. An important splenomegaly was found at physical examination. The results of the bone marrow aspiration (hypercellularity) and the cytogenetic analysis (chromosoma Ph in all metaphasis) allowed us to diagnose CML. The patient’s Sokal score was high (1.252). The patient was treated with hydroxyurea until 2002, when imatinib became available. Then she started imatinib at the dosage of 400 mg/die. Tests performed during the follow up showed a fast haematological response but no cytogenetic response in two years. The patient received imatinib until February 2004, when a psoriasiform-lichenoid dermatosis appeared. Therefore we decided to interrupt the therapy and the skin lesions disappeared. After starting again imatinib, also dermatosis reappeared, so we decided to interrupt imatinib definitively. On July 2007 the patient started dasatinib, a 2nd generation TKI. No adverse events occurred and cytogenetic analysis performed periodically was always positive (no response). She continued on dasatinib until May 2010, when she switched to nilotinib. In seven months a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) was documented with level"

BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation is the commonest mechanism implicated in imatinib resistance. In in-vitro studies, kinase domain mutations are variably resistant to second-line agents. We performed BCR-ABL kinase domain mutational studies in 25 patients in five institutions who failed imatinib and were treated with either nilotinib or dasatinib, to see if their mutational status would predict their clinical responses. Kinase domain mutations involving 11 amino acid substitutions were found in 12 (48%) patients. Most patients showed single kinase domain mutations.

Some caution is necessary when interpreting these studies, because many of the kinase blockers exhibit only relative specificity for the PDGF receptor, and some, such as the c-abl kinase inhibitor imatinib (STI 571), were developed primarily to inhibit other kinases and only reduce PDGFR-α and -β signaling as a “side effect.” Ki6896, like trapidil, worsened rat renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. 97 In contrast, in all other injury models tested, blockade of the PDGFR tyrosine kinase was beneficial. Thus, imatinib reduced mesangioproliferative changes in experimental glomerulonephritis 131 , 132 ; mildly ameliorated both renal functional and structural parameters in diabetic apolipoprotein E knockout mice 133 ; improved survival, renal function, and histology in murine lupus 134 ; and prevented chronic allograft nephropathy after rat kidney transplantation. 135 Finally, another PDGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG 1295, mildly delayed the development of interstitial fibrosis in rats with unilateral ureteral obstruction 136 ; however, at least in the case of imatinib, it is not always clear whether the benefit observed related to inhibition of the PDGFR tyrosine kinase or to inhibition of the c-abl kinase, which also contributes to renal interstitial fibrosis. 137 In addition, significant adverse effects of imatinib on the myocardium have been related to inhibition of the c-abl kinase rather than the PDGFR tyrosine kinase. 138 Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that inhibition of PDGF-B and -D can be an effective approach to proliferative glomerulonephritis and that both can also directly or indirectly affect the"

Current data suggest that depending on the context, there are various types of antineoplastic therapies which act through induction of autophagy. Anticancer agents (doxorubicin, temozolomide, etoposide), histone deacetylase inhibitors, imatinib and anti-estrogen hormonal therapy have been shown to induce autophagy [ 29 ].

Factors analyzed were: age, sex, time from diagnosis, prior interferon therapy, previous response to imatinib therapy, stage at the start of second-generation TKI therapy, clonal evolution, and type of mutations. By multivariate analysis, the stage of the disease (CP \u003e AP \u003e BP) at the start of second-generation TKI, the absence of intermediate or high IC 50 mutations (compared with no or low IC 50 mutations), and a previous MCyR to imatinib therapy were independently associated with the achievement of MCyR to second-generation TKIs and longer EFS and OS ( Table 5 ).

In our study, we assessed whether scoring mutation based on in vitro IC 50 of each TKI-mutation pair can predict long-term clinical outcome. The clinical efficacy of second-generation TKIs has been demonstrated across all phases of CML after imatinib failure, with high rates of hematologic and cytogenetic responses. 16 , 17 Our study confirmed and extended these findings in that: (1) second-generation TKI treatment resulted in hematologic and cytogenetic responses in a significant proportion of imatinib-resistant patients with BCR-ABL mutations; (2) patients with no baseline mutations and those with"

                    "more understanding of the nature of BCR-ABL as the pathologic basis of CML and its action as an overactive tyrosine kinase, targeted biological therapies that specifically inhibit the activity of BCR-ABL have been developed in the past 20 years [ 9 - 12 ]. These tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can induce complete remissions in CML and change the clinical course of CML. The first of these TKIs was imatinib mesylate (trade names: Gleevec and Glivec), which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2001, and has been considered the standard of care for more than a decade. Imatinib inhibited the progression of 65-75% of CML patients, but approximately 20-30% patients developed resistance and/or intolerance to imatinib [ 13 ]. To overcome drug resistance and to increase clinical response, second generation TKIs targeting BCR-ABL and other oncogenic tyrosine kinases have been developed. The first, dasatinib, a more potent inhibitor of BCR-ABL, was approved in 2007 by the US FDA to treat CML patients who were either resistant to or intolerant of imatinib. Nilotinib and dasatinib were then approved by the FDA for first-line therapy of Ph + CML in 2010. Both dasatinib and nilotinib are highly effective in newly diagnosed CML patients as well as those who fail imatinib. In 2012, radotinib was approved in South Korea only for use in CML patients resistant to or intolerant of imatinib. Another second generation TKI, bosutinib, received FDA approval in 2012 for the treatment of adult patients with Ph + CML with resistance, or intolerance to prior therapy [ 14 ]. Second generation TKIs have been demonstrated to induce better and faster clinical responses compared to imatinib and are highly effective in patients resistant to and/or intolerant to imatinib and are extremely active against all the resistant BCR-ABL1 mutations, with the exception of T3151 [ 14 ]. However, no survival advantage has been seen in CML patients [ 11 , 13 ]. Ponatinib is a third generation TKI, which causes response in both early and advanced phases of CML"

Since it was known that at least some fraction of CML stem cells are resistant to imatinib, as indicated by patient relapse following discontinuation of imatinib, 30 – 34 the speculation that the CML stem cell was the HSC led to an investigation of the imatinib sensitivity of Ph + HSCs. These studies demonstrated that HSCs from CML patients are in fact less sensitive to imatinib, strongly suggesting these cells are the leukemic stem cell in chronic phase. 29 , 46 More conclusive evidence that the HSC functions as the leukemic stem cell in most patients was provided by a recent study using QPCR analysis of sorted cell populations from imatinib-treated patients. This study showed that,"

Finally, the capacity of those formulations to achieve the desired therapeutic effect was also evaluated and a significant correlation between the reduction of BCR-ABL mRNA levels and the expected decrease of Bcr-Abl protein expression and cytotoxicity was observed [ 139 ]. Following these findings, we performed further studies aiming at generating Trf-SNALPs co-encapsulating anti- BCR-ABL siRNAs and imatinib. Imatinib is the first-line treatment for CML, which operates by effectively blocking Bcr-Abl activity (reviewed in [ 145 , 146 ]). Since many CML patients present with resistance and intolerance to imatinib, siRNAs and imatinib were co-encapsulated at different molar ratios. The developed Trf-SNALPs enabled the encapsulation of both siRNAs and imatinib at molar ratios that allowed reaching therapeutic doses, which clearly resulted in increased anti-tumoral activity [ 147 ]. This sort of approach is particularly attractive, since it allows triple targeting, while using a single therapeutic agent: the developed Trf-SNALPs are targeted to TrfR at the cancer cell surface, addressing two different molecular targets, BCR-ABL mRNA (through the use of siRNAs) and Bcr-Abl protein (through the use of imatinib) [ 147 ]. Similar efforts were conducted to design siRNA-containing SNALPs targeted to cancer cells and their tumor microenvironment. Actually, the aggressiveness of a tumor does not rely on the cancer cells alone, but rather on the cross-talk between cancer cells and other cells from the tumor microenvironment such as"

Pharmacokinetic Sample Analysis Blood samples were collected prior to Imatinib dosing on Day 2 (i.e. 24 hours after the first dose) and again on Day 29 (steady state trough level). The plasma concentrations of Imatinib and CGP74588 were determined by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectronomy (LC/MS/MS). The limit of quantification was 5 ng/ml for both Imatinib and CGP74588; the assay was fully validated (Bakhtiar R, Lohne J, Ramos L, Khemani L, Hayes M, Tse F; J Chromatog B Anal Technol Biomed Life Sci. 2002; 768:325-40.) The accuracy and precision were 104%±6% at the lower limit of quantification and 99%±5% to 108%±5% over the entire concentration range of 4-10,000 ng/ml. Data Analysis Trough plasma concentrations (C min value) of Imatinib and its metabolite after the first dose and at steady state were analyzed and correlation analysis was performed retrospectively with clinical responses including CCR and MMR, as well as patient disposition after 2 and 5 years of treatment. Correlation of PK trough levels with age, gender, body weight and body surface area was assessed. Plasma trough levels of both Imatinib and CGP74588 on Days 2 and 29 were grouped into four quartiles. The lower quartile (Q1) includes data on the 25% of patients with the lowest observed concentration values, whereas quartiles Q2 and 03 extend 25% below and above the median concentration, respectively. The upper quartile (Q4) includes the 25%"

Duration of therapy or disease duration may also play a role, as one study evaluating 319 patients taking imatinib for chronic-phase CML who were consistently screened for mutations found that 6.6% of patients with early chronic-phase CML had developed BCR-ABL mutations after five years, compared with 17% of patients in late chronic-phase CML.

In the ENESTnd study, analysis of mutation evolution during the first 24 months in patients with lack or loss of MMR showed a 5-fold increase in transcript level and, at the end of treatment, encouragingly revealed a substantially lower proportion of patients having evolved mutations on the nilotinib arm compared with the imatinib arm. Of these, the absolute number of cases in which the T315I mutation was detected was equivalent. Notably, 2 of 10 patients in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily arm who evolved new mutations demonstrated evidence of mutations not previously associated with loss of response to nilotinib, including one case of disease progression that was associated with the E459K mutation. 30 A similar analysis has been performed in patients in the DASISION study, in which mutation analysis was performed in patients who discontinued for any reason (dasatinib, n = 59; imatinib, n = 64). 29 BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations were detected in 10 patients in each arm; notably, 7 of the 10 mutations detected in the dasatinib arm were T315I, whereas this mutation was not detected in any of the imatinib-treated patients.

Imatinib mesylate binds to the inactive conformation of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase suppressing the Philadelphia chromosome positive clone in CML. Clinical studies have yielded impressive results in all phases of CML. With higher rates of complete cytogenetic response with imatinib, molecular monitoring of disease is now advisable in assessing response and determining prognosis. Emergence of resistance to imatinib may be manifest at the hematologic, cytogenetic, or molecular levels in patients who remain in chronic phase, or may be evidenced by the development of more advanced CML phases. Resistance and eventual clinical failure of imatinib occurs in most patients with blastic phase disease. Resistance may occur at the level of Bcr-Abl, with reduction or loss of imatinib effectiveness as a kinase inhibitor, or, despite retention of its inhibitory ability, with changes in the ability to deliver an effective dose at the cellular level, and/or, the leukemia becoming less dependent on Bcr-Abl. The various mechanisms underlying these differing, non-mutually exclusive, mechanisms of resistance must be understood to develop corresponding therapeutic remedies. We review the current data on imatinib in CML, the criteria for diagnosis of imatinib resistance, and the mechanisms that underlie such resistance in CML. \n                               \n                                              "

Tanshinone IIA and Cryptotanshinone Synergistically Promote Anticancer Effects with Imatinib in K562 Cells Bcr-abl is an abnormal gene formed by the reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 in CML [ 29 ]. We examined whether tanshinone IIA or cryptotanshinone can affect activation of bcr-abl by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 5(a) , both tanshinone IIA and cryptotanshinone reduced phosphorylation of bcr-abl in a dose-dependent manner. Then, to test the synergy between tanshinone IIA or cryptotanshinone and imatinib, a competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of CML [ 30 ], K562 cells were cotreated with tanshinone IIA or cryptotanshinone (0, 2.5, or 5  μ M) in the absence or presence of imatinib (0.25  μ M) for 24 h. The cell viability was significantly decreased in combination of tanshinone IIA or cryptotanshinone with imatinib in a dose-dependent manner compared to untreated control ( Figure 5(b) ). Tanshinone IIA remarkably showed the synergistic effect on the imatinib-induced apoptosis with CI value = 0.315 and 0.628 at 2.5 and 5  μ M, respectively ( Figure 5(c) ). In contrast, cryptotanshinone treatment with imatinib had the synergistic effect only at 2.5  μ M (CI = 0.776) while showing the additional effect at 5  μ M (CI = 1.048) ( Figure 5(c) ). Furthermore, combination treatment of imatinib and tanshinone IIA synergistically increased the apoptotic population of Annexin V-PI double positive stained cells to 16%, while single treatment of imatinib or tanshinone IIA induced 4.96% and 9.18% apoptosis in K562, respectively ( Figure 5(d) ).

In light of this new evidence, the patient expressed her wishes not to undergo aggressive re-induction chemotherapy regimen followed by additional donor lymphocyte infusions. Due to this relapse, in January 2011, fourteen months after her transplant, imatinib was discontinued and nilotinib was started at a dose of 800 mg daily (400 mg p.o.b.i.d.). In February 2011, another biopsy was performed and the morphology by flow cytometry was much improved, but residual acute lymphoblastic leukemia was detected, with approximately 4.4% CD34+ TDT + blasts.

However, as compared with the initial diagnosis, the number of circulating CD26 + LSCs is decreased to low or undetectable levels during TKI treatment or TFR ( 27 , 28 ). A possible LSC threshold for achieving and maintaining TFR still requires investigation. We found no difference in TFR at 6, 12, and 24 months between patients receiving imatinib and second-generation TKIs. Of note, previous studies demonstrated that second-generation TKIs could induce a relatively faster and higher DMR as compared with imatinib ( 29 – 31 ). Moreover, in patients with failure of imatinib treatment for a prolonged time, a deeper molecular response can be obtained upon salvage with nilotinib ( 32 ). Thus, a reasonable strategy is using a more potent TKI to increase the number of candidates for discontinuing treatment, thereby potentially increasing the number of patients with successful TKI discontinuation, despite"

Drug inhibition kinetic and dose escalation experiments To measure the short-term (de-)phosphorylation kinetics after imatinib treatment a protocol with a rapid ethanol fixation step was adapted from ( 63 ). For this, p210 Bcr-Abl Ba/F3 cells were grown in RPMI media with 10% FBS. The media was replaced with fresh RPMI supplemented with 0.5% FBS to prevent serum protein precipitation in the ethanol fixation step. After 1h of equilibration time the time course was initiated by the addition of 2.5 μM imatinib or the respective volume of the solvent (DMSO). At the indicated time points the incubation was terminated rapidly by addition of 80% (v/v) ethanol at -20°C. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and lysed as above by sonication in urea buffer.

When using such assumptions, a drug cannot alter the proliferation rate of either sensitive or resistance cancer cells. A main effect of targeted therapies (e.g., imatinib, erlotininb, gefitinib), however, is the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. Reduced growth rates of cancer cells in turn lead to a diminished probability of resistance since there is less chance that resistant cells arise during sensitive cell divisions. To relax this assumption, we utilized a non-homogenous multi-type birth-death process model"

Finally, the very recently developed Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTAC)-based kinase inhibitors are presented. \n 1. Introduction One of the most spectacular breakthroughs in cancer therapy in the past 20 years is undoubtedly represented by the introduction of imatinib mesylate for the treatment of Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) leukemia [ 1 , 2 ]. The success of imatinib instilled the idea that most tumors could be treated by a single, targeted drug that inhibits the main driver of transformation. However, the initial enthusiasm subsided when it became clear that, on the contrary, most tumors harbor at least two or more driver lesions, all of which need to be"

A few drugs specifically target resistant mutations such as T315I present in a subgroup of patients with CML. These mutations may develop at the time of resistance to imatinib or other TKIs, and the development of such mutations may signal the imminent need for AHPCT. Changes in transplantation for CML Several reports have documented a decline in annual transplantation rates for CML. The German Registry of SCT group observed a 28% reduction in annual transplant rates between 1998 and"

In CML, it was reported that expression of COX-2 was significantly higher in CML than in healthy volunteers and the increasing levels of COX-2 were significantly associated with shorter survival ( Giles et al, 2002 ). Therefore several studies have been conducted to investigate the role of COX-2 in imatinib resistance and the use of COX-2 inhibitors as an alternative therapy. It has been reported that celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, reduced cell growth with arrest of the cell cycle at G0/G1 phase and induction of apoptosis by inhibiting NF-κB activation in K562 cells ( Subhashini et al, 2005 ).

STI571 frequently induces remarkable hematologic and cytogenetic responses in these clinical settings. However, recent clinical studies with STI571 in CML demonstrated that many patients at the advanced stage respond well but then relapse (6), (7). Resistance to STI571 because of enhanced expression or mutation of BCR-ABL gene has been found in CML patients (8), (9).

To separate the apoptotic effect of KIT suppression relative to the down-regulation of antiapoptotic proteins, we used small interfering RNA-directed knockdown of KIT. Results show that focused suppression of KIT alone is sufficient to induce apoptosis in GIST cells, but not to the same extent as flavopiridol. In contrast, imatinib mesylate, which inhibits KIT kinase activity but does not suppress total KIT expression, fails to cause apoptosis. We also show that flavopiridol suppresses KIT mRNA expression through positive transcriptional elongation factor inhibition and decreases KIT promoter activity.

For example, because they can distinguish cancer cells from their normal counterparts, agents such as imatinib mesylate, a Bcr-Abl and Kit kinase inhibitor, can result in remarkable responses with minimal host toxicity in patients suffering from diseases characterized by abnormalities in the targeted kinases. Indeed, studies of imatinib mesylate in early-stage chronic myelogenous leukemia, whose hallmark is the aberrant Bcr-Abl, show response rates of more than 90%. Furthermore, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), a notoriously chemotherapy-refractory sarcoma, characterized by activating Kit kinase mutations, can show dramatic metabolic responses within days after initiation of treatment.

In addition, White et al 23 reported a 36% probability of achieving a 2‐log reduction in low in vitro baseline inhibitory concentration 50% for imatinib (IC50 ≤0.6 μmol/L) by 3 months, suggesting the importance of intrinsic sensitivity to TKIs. Theoretically, BCR‐ABL1 transcript levels at baseline and at specific time points within 3 months can precisely reflect the in vivo intrinsic sensitivity irrespective of external contributing factors.

Statistical analysis ANOVA test of the effects at the three defined time points explicitly accounting for the individual experiments revealed no systemic batch effect of the two experiments. Thus, for statistical analysis, we pooled the data of both experiments to achieve a better estimate of the true population variability. Effects of imatinib treatment on bone metabolism were evaluated in comparison to age-related controls in two steps. First, imatinib effects on growth were estimated by linear regression during the entire 10-week exposure time. For statistical analysis of the body weight by linear regression, measurements at start and week 2, 4, and 10 of exposure, respectively, were treated as equidistant to ensure linearity of the regression. Therefore, reported ‘growth rates’ correspond to mean growth per interval (start to week 2, week 2 to week 4, week 4 to week 10) rather as to growth rate per week. Second, to disclose imatinib effects according to developmental stages, ANOVA was used to estimate effects at the defined time points pre-, pubertal, and postpubertal. Paragraphs of the results sections are structured by first describing observed skeletal effects by imatinib on bone growth over 10-weeks of exposure and afterwards separately at the three mentioned developmental stages. In the text, skeletal effects of imatinib exposure are given in % in relation to age-related controls. Unless otherwise specified, results presented in tables and figures are showing mean ± 95% CI.

In previous studies authors have evaluated the combination of type I and type II kinase inhibitors in other tyrosine kinase-mutant cancers. For example, the combination of the BCR-Abl/cKit inhibitors imatinib and dasatinib (type II and type I, respectively) resulted in greater antitumor effects compared with imatinib monotherapy in a mouse model of gastrointestinal stromal tumor containing a cKit V558 deletion mutation. 32 In addition, the combination of ponatinib (type II) with midostaurin (type I) had synergistic effects on neoplastic mast cells containing the cKit D816V mutation. 33 Furthermore, it has been shown that imatinib and dasatinib combination therapy suppresses the outgrowth of imatinib-resistant BCR-Abl mutations in vitro. 34 Whether treatment with the combination of crenolanib and sorafenib similarly suppresses the development of sorafenib-resistant clones with FLT3 KD mutations is currently being tested.

As toxicity thresholds are reached and chemotherapy modifications yield fewer returns, rationally designed targeted therapies become not only preferable, but necessary. Dramatic improvements in overall survival achieved in Ph + ALL with the addition of imatinib set the paradigm for molecularly targeted therapy. 35 Promising targets in Ph-negative ALL are emerging through the advancement of high-throughput genome-wide analyses and next-generation sequencing techniques. 9 Advanced genomic analyses have identified several kinase-activating lesions in Ph-like ALL, including mutations and rearrangements that result in activation of JAKs. 3 ,"

The first, probably the most famous targeted therapy that was developed for cancer, was in a disease called CML: chronic myelogenous leukemia. There’s a very characteristic arrangement in the chromosomes that leads something called the Philadelphia chromosome, which activates a kinase called ABL. Imatinib, which is otherwise known as Gleevec, is a potent inhibitor of ABL, and so the development of inhibitors that inhibit ABL were the first types of so-called targeted therapies for cancer that were developed. These drugs revolutionized the management of CNL, where uniformly, patients either died or had to undergo a bone marrow transplant within 3"

[Jan H Beumer, Venkateswaran C Pillai, Robert A Parise, Susan M Christner, Brian F Kiesel, Michelle A Rudek, Raman Venkataramanan] PMID 26178713 Abstract Inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A, such as ritonavir and efavirenz, may be used as part of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to treat HIV patients. HIV patients with chronic myeloid leukemia or gastrointestinal stromal tumour may need imatinib, a CYP3A4 substrate with known exposure response-relationships. Administration of imatinib to patients on ritonavir or efavirenz may result in altered imatinib exposure leading to increased toxicity or failure of therapy, respectively. We used primary human hepatocyte cultures to evaluate the magnitude of interaction between imatinib and ritonavir/efavirenz. Hepatocytes were pre-treated with vehicle, ritonavir, ketoconazole, efavirenz or rifampicin, and the metabolism of imatinib was characterized over time. Concentrations of imatinib and metabolite were quantitated in combined lysate and medium, using LC-MS. The predicted changes in imatinib CLoral (95% CI) with ketoconazole, ritonavir, rifampicin and efavirenz were 4.0-fold (0, 9.2) lower, 2.8-fold (0.04, 5.5) lower, 2.9-fold (2.2, 3.5) higher and 2.0-fold (0.42, 3.5) higher, respectively. These predictions were in good agreement with clinical single dose drug-drug interaction studies, but not with reports of imatinib interactions at steady-state. Alterations in metabolism were similar after acute or chronic imatinib exposure. In vitro human hepatocytes predicted increased clearance of imatinib with inducers and decreased clearance with inhibitors of CYP enzymes. The impact of HAART on imatinib may depend on whether it is being initiated or has already been dosed chronically in patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring may have a role in optimizing imatinib therapy in this patient population.

The third implication is that we need ways to predict response to therapy in both the upfront and resistance settings. Previous Section Next Section Can We Predict Response? In the debate of what therapies should be offered in newly diagnosed chronic phase CML (imatinib, imatinib + interferon, dasatinib, or nilotinib), biomarkers that would predict response would seem quite useful. However, despite much effort, there are no clear winners yet. Functional Studies. TKIs are among the class of drugs potentially imported and exported by drug influx and efflux pumps, respectively. For example, imatinib can be imported by OCT-1, and exported by ABCB1 and ABCG2. Several in vitro studies measuring OCT-1 activity by imatinib uptake in mononuclear cells have demonstrated that cells demonstrating high OCT-1 activity, compared with low activity, have higher response rates (in survival, EFS, molecular response, and mutation rate), compared with cells with lower OCT-1 activity. 41 – 43 These data reiterate the fundamental importance of Bcr-Abl inhibition in response, genetic instability, and resistance. Other studies have suggested that mRNA OCT-1 levels (which are much easier to measure) also correlate well with response. 44 However, although intracellular imatinib levels are influenced by OCT-1, the second-generation TKIs, dasatinib and nilotinib, are not. However for the later two agents, activity with ABC efflux pumps may be involved in maintaining intracellular drug levels. Genetic Studies. Single nucleotide polymorphism arrays can measure associations of specific gene polymorphisms with phenotype (in this case,"

This third approval in late December 2002 comes within 14 months of the initial approval of Glivec in the EU and follows a positive opinion from the EU's Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) received in September 2002. The EC's approval of Glivec as first-line therapy for adult patients was based on 12-month data from a large head-to-head study comparing Glivec with a combination of interferon-alpha and cytosine arabinoside (IFN/Ara-C), a traditional treatment for CML. In the International Randomized Study of Interferon vs. STI571 (IRIS), patients treated with Glivecgiven orally at 400 mg per daywere nine times more likely to achieve a complete cytogenetic response, a major goal of CML treatment, compared with those treated with the combination. In addition, Glivec significantly delayed the time to progression to the more advanced stages of CML. The pediatric approval was based on a Phase I study of children with Ph+ CML who had failed prior IFN therapy. The results of this study indicated similar efficacy and safety as seen in adults. \"The rapid decision of EU health authorities should allow appropriate newly diagnosed CML patients access to Glivec early in the course of their disease, when its potential benefits are greatest,\" said David Epstein, President, Novartis Oncology. \"In addition, these patients are more likely to benefit sooner from an improved quality of life as compared with those on traditional therapies.\" Clinical data Updated 18-month data from the IRIS"

Our understanding of the last three disorders has lagged behind in comparison to our understanding of the molecular basis of CML, which led to the development of the first targeted therapy, imatinib. Polycythemia vera was described by two giants of medicine, Vasquez in 1892 and William Osler in 1903, who both noted rubor and strokes (and other thrombotic complications) as a manifestation of this disease. As summarized by one of many life-long students of polycythemia vera, Thomas Pearson (who popularized phlebotomy therapy),"

Imatinib mesylate loaded PLGA microspheres with a size of 6-20 μm were prepared by a double emulsion (W1/O/W2) method using dichloromethane as volatile solvent. It was found that the microspheres were spherical with a non-porous surface; imatinib loading efficiency (LE) was highly dependent on the pH of the external water phase (W2). By increasing the pH of W2 phase above the highest pKa of imatinib (pKa 8.1), at which imatinib is mainly uncharged, the LE increased from 10% to 90% (pH 5.0 versus pH 9.0). Conversely, only 4% of its counter ion, mesylate, was retained in the microspheres at the same condition (pH 9.0). Since mesylate is highly water soluble, it is unlikely that it partitions into the organic phase. We demonstrated, using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), that imatinib was molecularly dispersed in the polymeric matrix at loadings up to 8.0%. At higher drug loading, imatinib partially crystallized in the matrix. Imatinib microspheres released their cargo during three months by a combination of diffusion through the polymer matrix and polymer erosion. In conclusion, we have formulated imatinib microspheres with high LE and LC. Although we started with a double emulsion of imatinib mesylate, the obtained microspheres contained imatinib base which was mainly molecularly dispersed in the polymer matrix. These microspheres release imatinib over a 3-month period which is of interest for local treatment of cancer. \n                               \n                                        "

For the commercial and Medicare plans, we assumed that 74% of PA applications for branded TKI use in first-line treatment would be approved, and that the administrative cost of each would be $20. 17 To evaluate the secondary study objective, a requirement for use of a preferred branded TKI was applied in addition to step therapy through generic imatinib. We assumed that patients new to TKI therapy and patients switching TKI therapy would be affected by this formulary management strategy. As with the primary objective, we assumed that 74% of PA requests for nonpreferred branded TKIs would be approved in both health plans, with an administrative cost of $20 each. 17 Model Parameters An interactive, Microsoft Excel–based model was developed to estimate the pharmacy budget impact of the loss of patent exclusivity for branded imatinib and the incremental impact of formulary restrictions on branded TKIs after the introduction of generic imatinib. The model was developed from a US commercial and Medicare payer perspective with a 2-year period after the introduction of generic imatinib. The TKIs included in the model were imatinib (branded and generic), dasatinib, and nilotinib. The model permitted analysis of the results by plan type (commercial or Medicare), form of patient cost-sharing (coinsurance or copayment), and price of generic imatinib with and without a 180-day exclusivity period.

However, here we report the first 6 cases (3 in a phase I/II French study and 3 in a phase II US study [ref. 7 ]) of GISTs that did not display the target mutations of Gleevec but still exhibited objective tumor responses. We analyzed the genomic DNA in these 6 paraffin-embedded primary GISTs and did not find any mutations in the following Gleevec targets: c-kit exons 9, 11, 13, and 17, and PDGFRα exons 12, 14, and 18. However, 2 patients presenting with liver, stomach, or lung metastases did exhibit complete responses to Gleevec with 26 months of disease-free survival. One patient presenting with liver metastases displayed a partial response with 24 months of progression-free survival (PFS), and 3 patients exhibited stable disease (7, 15, and 17 months of PFS) (see Supplemental Table 1A; supplemental material available at http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/114/3/379/DC1). This finding prompted the search for an alternate mode of action of Gleevec that is not cell autonomous. In vivo efficacy of Gleevec in tumors resistant to Gleevec in vitro. Accordingly, we identified several mouse tumor models resistant to the antiproliferative effects of Gleevec in vitro (Figure (Figure1A) 1 A) but sensitive to Gleevec in vivo. While B16F10 melanoma cell proliferation was not inhibited by micromolar concentrations of Gleevec in vitro, the establishment of B16 lung metastases in C57BL/6 mice was significantly hampered by oral feeding with Gleevec (Figure (Figure1B). 1 B). Gleevec also induced significant antitumor effects against the AK7 mesothelioma and the MCA102 fibrosarcoma models (data not shown). The Gleevec-mediated antitumor effects could be potentiated by the adjunction of FL, a hematopoietic growth factor endowed with immunostimulatory capacities ( 10 ). Indeed, a short administration of Gleevec (4 days) combined with FL (FL+Gleevec) promoted synergistic antitumor effects against established AK7 mesothelioma with up to 45% tumor-free mice using FL+Gleevec versus 14% using FL alone or 0% using Gleevec alone (Figure (Figure1C). 1 C). Similarly, the combination of FL and Gleevec prevented 100% of mice from developing the transporter associated with antigen processing–deficient (TAP-deficient) RMA-S lymphoma, whereas neither FL nor Gleevec alone prevented this lymphoma (Figure (Figure2A). 2 A). It is noteworthy that tumor-free mice were not immune to autologous tumor cells, since rechallenge was lethal in most cases (data not shown). Therefore, Gleevec alone or in combination with FL significantly curtails tumor progression in tumor models resistant to Gleevec in vitro, which suggests a non–cell autonomous mode of action. Open in a separate window Figure 1 Gleevec prevented tumor progression in vivo in tumor models resistant to the Gleevec antiproliferative effects in vitro.

AK7, B16F10 (B16), RMA-S, MCA 102, or BAF3p210 cells (bearing the BCR/ABL translocation) were incubated for 24 hours with the indicated doses of Gleevec, and the absolute number of surviving cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion assay. Proliferation indexes are shown. The Wilcoxon two-sample rank sum test was used to compare the proliferation indexes (* P \u003c 0.05). ( B ) Gleevec prevents establishment of B16F10 lung metastases. We injected 5 × 10 5 B16F10 tumor cells in the tail vein at day 0. Oral feeding with Gleevec (150 mg/kg bid) or H 2 O (200 μl) was administered on days 5–11 and mice were sacrificed for the enumeration of lung metastases on day 11. The data from 3 independent experiments, each including 5–7 mice per group, were pooled and are depicted. The Wilcoxon two-sample rank sum test was used to compare the number of lung metastases (** P \u003c 0.05, Gleevec versus H 2 O). ( C ) FL and Gleevec synergize to eradicate AK7. We inoculated 3 × 10 6 AK7 tumor cells in the abdominal flank of C57BL/6 mice on day 0. FL was started at day 11 when AK7 tumors reached a diameter of 20 ± 20 mm 2 . FL was continued for 10 days and combined with Gleevec the day before FL arrest and for 8 consecutive days (same doses as in B ). Each experiment included 5–7 mice/group and was repeated twice with similar results. The Kruskal Wallis multiple comparison test was used for statistical analyses and significant effects are signified by triple asterisks. Open in a separate window Figure 2 Gleevec promoted NK cell–dependent antitumor effects. ( A and B ) FL and Gleevec synergize to prevent RMA-S tumor establishment. In one abdominal flank of C57BL/6 mice, TAP-deficient RMA-S cells were injected ( A ), whereas TAP-sufficient RMA cells were injected into the other flank of the same mice ( B ). The same number of cells of each type were injected (10 6 cells). From 6 days before injection (day –6) to day 3, FL (10 μg/day) or PBS (200 μl) was injected intraperitoneally. From day 1 to day 4, Gleevec (150 mg/kg bid) or H 2 O (200 μl) was administered orally. The number of tumor-free mice at the end of the experiment is indicated in parentheses. Each experiment included 5 mice per group and was repeated twice with similar results. ( C ) The antitumor effects of Gleevec against B16F10 lung metastases are mediated by NK cells. Neutralizing anti-NK1.1 mAb (300 μg of PK136 mAb/mouse) or normal mouse serum (NMS) were administered intraperitoneally at days –4, -–2, 0, and 4 in C57BL/6 mice. At day 0, 5 × 10 5 B16F10 tumor cells were inoculated into the tail vein. Oral feeding with Gleevec (150 mg/kg bid) or H 2 O (200 μl) was administered on days 5–11, and mice were sacrificed for the enumeration of lung metastases at day 11. The results of one representative experiment (of 2) including 5–7 mice per group are shown. The Kruskal Wallis multiple comparison test was used to compare the number of lung metastases (* P \u003c 0.05 between Gleevec and H 2 O in NMS groups; ** P \u003c 0.01 between NMS and anti-NK1.1 mAb in Gleevec groups; there was no significant difference between H 2 O and Gleevec in anti-NK1.1 mAb groups). Gleevec promotes NK cell–dependent antitumor effects. The combination of FL and Gleevec was unable to protect mice against the development of TAP-sufficient RMA tumors (Figure (Figure2B). 2 B). Since TAP-deficient tumor cells are known to be elective NK cell targets ( 11 ), and since immunosurveillance against AK7 and B16 involved NK cells ( 10 , 12 ), we hypothesized that NK"

The administration of imatinib mesylate significantly reduced the average tumor size in the mice transplanted with DU145 cells and the PZ stromal cells from day 54 to 63 after cell injection, while this inhibition of tumorigenesis was not apparent in the mice transplanted with DU145 cells only (Fig. (Fig.7A 7 A and B).

C) Western blot for C-Kit of epithelial cells from tumors showed reduced expression of C-Kit in the tumors from the mice treated with imatinib mesylate. Because we observed up-regulated C-Kit expression in the epithelial cells of tumors in the DU145+PZ group of mice, we thus asked whether the inhibition of tumorigenesis conveyed by imatinib mesylate decreased the expression of C-Kit in the epithelial cells using Western blotting. We found that, in both groups of mice (DU145 and DU145+PZ), administration of imatinib mesylate apparently decreased the C-Kit expression in the epithelial cells of tumors (Fig. (Fig.7 7 C). 4.

After careful consultation of the potential risks and benefits, all patients as well as a safety cohort of 9 subsequent cases decided to continue the imatinib therapy. After adjusting the target international normalized ratio (INR) to around 2.0, no further cases of SDH occurred during 50 patient-years. Long-term treatment with imatinib may improve the functional class and quality of life. Single cases might even attain hemodynamic remission. The occurrence of 5% SDH per patient-years is concerning.

The survival of patient with T315I mutation is reflective of the disease phase at the time of mutation detection, reported to be 22, 28, 4, and 4.9 months in patients with CP-, AP-, BP-CML, and Ph + ALL, respectively ( 22 ). Despite the remarkable activity of the second-generation TKIs in patients with CML who are refractory to imatinib therapy, none of these agents are active in patients with T315I mutation ( 23, 24 ). Structure and Mechanism of Action of Ponatinib A decade after T315I mutation was indentified, the solution of the crystal structures of ABL kinase domain in complex with imatinib clarified the nature of the resistance and led to the design of ponatinib. Ponatinib (Iclusig, ARIAD Pharmaceuticals) is a third-generation structure-guided, rationally designed TKI aimed to overcome the resistance of the T315 mutation by avoiding the interaction with the side chain of 315I. Ponatinib, similarly to imatinib, targets the inactive conformation of Abl kinase. Its essential structural characteristic is a triple carbon–carbon bond (ethynyl linkage) between the purine and methylphenyl groups, able to accommodate the Isl side chain without steric hindrance. Ponatinib derivatives with altered ethynyl linkers exhibit markedly diminished activity against T315I in cellular essays, highlighting"

All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software (version 11.03; SPSS, Tokyo, Japan) and the results were considered to be significant when the P -value was \u003c0.05 and highly significant when the P -value was \u003c0.01. EOL-1R cells were resistant to anti-leukemia agents EOL-1 and EOL-1R cells were grown in a liquid culture for 2 days in the presence of various concentrations of imatinib (0.03–1 n M ). Growth inhibition was measured by MTT assay and the percentage of inhibition was plotted graphically ( ). EOL-1R cells were resistant to imatinib ( ). We next explored the effect of the conventional anti-leukemia agent, AraC (30–100 n M ), on the proliferation of EOL-1 and EOL-1R cells. EOL-1R cells were relatively resistant to these agents compared with EOL-1 cells. In addition, we explored the effect of AraC on the colony-forming ability of EOL-1 and EOL-1R cells. AraC (3 or 10 n M ) inhibited the colony-forming ability of EOL-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner with an inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC 50 ) of 6 n M ; however, EOL-1R cells were relatively resistant to AraC (data not shown). Effects of imatinib on PDGFRα and its downstream signals in EOL-1 and EOL-1R cells We previously found that FIP1L1/PDGFRα stimulated AKT, ERK and STAT5 signaling, leading to the proliferation of EOL-1 cells. We therefore assessed the effect of imatinib on the activation of these pro-survival signals in EOL-1 and EOL-1R cells by using flow cytometry and western blot analyses ( ). The exposure of EOL-1 cells to imatinib (1 n M , 3 h) potently decreased the levels of p-PDGFRα in EOL-1 cells, as measured by flow cytometry ( ). In parallel, the exposure of EOL-1 cells to imatinib (1 n M , 3 h) profoundly decreased the levels of p-ERK, p-AKT and p-STAT5, without a decrease in the levels of the total amount of these proteins ( ). Similarly, imatinib (1 n M , 3 h) potently downregulated the levels of p-PDGFRα in EOL-1R cells ( ). However, AKT and ERK remained activated in EOL-1R cells after exposure to imatinib ( ). The levels of p-STAT5 were downregulated in both EOL-1 and EOL-1R cells after exposure to imatinib ( ), suggesting that STAT5 was also active in EOL-1R cells through a PDGFRα-independent mechanism. Analysis of cell-cycle distribution of EOL-1R cells We next explored the difference of cell-cycle distribution between EOL-1 and EOL-1R cells. Either 32±2 or 45±1% of EOL-1 cells were in the S phase or the G 0 /G 1 phase of the cell cycle, respectively ( ). Conversely, merely 16±3% of the EOL-1R cells were accumulated in the S phase and approximately 65±4% of these cells stayed in the G 0 /G 1 phase of the cell cycle ( ). Effect of imatinib on cell-cycle regulators A greater number of EOL-1R cells stayed in a dormant state than the parental EOL-1 cells. We therefore expected that cell-cycle-related molecules would be modulated in the EOL-1R cells. To confirm our hypothesis, we explored the levels of p21 waf1 , p27 kip1 , p53 and c-Myc"

                    "As the targeted kinases are similar in benign and malignant disorders, this observation is unlikely due to a different way of interaction with their targets. Most TKIs are actively transported into targeted cells, as they are poorly lipophilic and cannot passively pass the cell membrane. This uptake process is well known to regulate the efficacy of these drugs and its importance has been shown for the best-analyzed TKI Imatinib. Its uptake in leukocytes, the target cells in CML treatment, directly regulates the efficacy of Imatinib [9] . The human organic cation transporter 1 (hOCT1) has been suggested to mediate leukocyte uptake [10] . Lately, further transporters have been proposed to interact with Imatinib; among them the human multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 1 (hMATE1) [11] . A main target of Imatinib and other TKIs in RA are synovial fibroblasts (SF) as they potently mediate synovial hyperplasia leading to joint destruction [12] . To date, the mechanisms by which fibroblasts accumulate TKIs are unknown. This study aims to evaluate the importance of this transport process for the delivery of TKIs in RA and its pathology induced regulation exemplary for Imatinib. Results hMATE1 Transports Imatinib with Higher Affinity than other OCT To find out whether other transporters than hOCT1 are responsible for Imatinib delivery in RA, we investigated its transport by hOCTN1, hOCTN2 and hMATE1. Therefore, the uptake of transfected HEK293 cells was compared to WT-HEK293 cells having an absolute transport rate of 0.19±0.02 fmol Imatinib/cell (n = 16) which is set to 100%. Both, hOCTN1 and hMATE1 are able to translocate Imatinib as HEK293 cells that were transfected with these transporters showed a significantly higher accumulation than WT-HEK293 cells (+59±27%, n = 10 for hOCTN1 and +36±6%, n = 6 for hMATE1, Fig. 1A ). In contrast, hOCTN2 transfected HEK293 cells did not significantly differ in the Imatinib uptake from WT-HEK293 cells ( Fig. 1A ), indicating no significant transport by hOCTN2. According to its properties as H + /organic cation antiporter, the transport by hMATE1 was pH dependent since it decreased by 69±1% (n = 5) when the extracellular pH was set to 6.4 ( Fig. 1B ). Next, we compared the apparent affinities of hOCT1, hMATE1 and hOCTN1 for Imatinib by inhibiting the uptake of their model substrate ASP + ( Fig. 1C ). Calculated IC 50 values revealed a remarkably higher apparent affinity of Imatinib to hMATE1 (IC 50  = 21 nM) than to hOCT1 (IC 50  = 5 µM) and hOCTN1 (IC 50  = 31 µM). Experiments for hMATE1 were also performed at an extracellular acidic pH showing a severely decreased apparent affinity ( Fig. S3 ). Open in a separate window Figure 1 Properties of Imatinib transport by hOCTN1, hOCTN2 and hMATE1. A) Specific Imatinib uptake (10 µM) in transfected HEK293 cells given as difference of accumulation at 4°C and at 37°C measured by HPLC. B) Effect of extracellular pH on the specific Imatinib uptake (10 µM) in hMATE1 transfected HEK293 cells. C) Apparent affinities of Imatinib on hOCT1 (IC 50  = 5 µM), hOCTN1 (IC 50  = 31 µM) and hMATE1 (IC 50  = 118 nM) measured by concentration dependent inhibition of ASP + uptake. Results show number of observation in brackets. Values are mean ± SEM. * indicates statistically significant effects (P\u003c0.05). hMATE1 Mainly Mediates Imatinib Uptake in hRASF First we investigated whether hRASF are capable to actively accumulate Imatinib by quantifying their uptake via HPLC. The significantly higher uptake at 37°C (3.6±0.5 nmol/mg protein, n = 10) than under inhibition of metabolic processes at 4°C (1.4±0.2 nmol/mg protein n = 10) indicates a transporter-mediated process ( Fig. 2A ). Thus, the expression of potential Imatinib transporters (hOCT1, hOCT2, hOCTN1 and hMATE1) in hRASF was quantified by qRT-PCR and compared to hOASF ( Fig. 2B ). hOCT1 is expressed at low levels in hRASF (0.012±0.005% of GAPDH, n = 10) and hOCT2 mRNA is not detectable in any sample. In contrast, hOCTN1 (2.0±0.8%, n = 9) is expressed at a higher level. hMATE1-mRNA was found to be expressed relevantly in SF with a lower expression in hRASF (0.09±0.02%, n = 8) than hOASF (0.18±0.08%, n = 6), although the difference in the expression did not reach a significant level. Open in a separate window Figure 2 hRASF actively accumulate Imatinib and express several OCTs. A) Temperature dependent uptake of Imatinib (10 µM) in hRASF at 4°C (black column) and 37°C (white column) measured by HPLC. B) Expression of investigated transporters in hRASF (white columns) and hOASF (black columns) determined by qRT-PCR. Values are mean ± SEM. n.d. = not detected. To test the direct influence of the individual transporters on Imatinib uptake we measured its cellular accumulation in hRASF after co-incubation with specific transporter inhibitors. Inhibition of hOCT1 by MPP + and hOCTN1 by ergothioneine did not change Imatinib uptake ( Fig. 3A ). In contrast, inhibition of hMATE1 by 200 nM pyrimethamine reduced the Imatinib accumulation in hRASF by 67±10% (n = 3) ( Fig. 3A ), suggesting that the uptake in hRASF is mainly mediated by hMATE1. These results were confirmed by quantifying the uptake after a knockdown of hMATE1 expression by a specific siRNA ( Fig. 3B ). Transfection of hRASF with hMATE1 siRNA for 192 h was needed to significantly reduce hMATE1 protein as well as mRNA expression. The down-regulation of hMATE1 resulted in a significant decrease of Imatinib uptake compared to transfection experiments with a scrambled siRNA (2.8±0.1 vs 4.9±0.1 nmol/mg protein, both n = 3) ( Fig. 3B ). These findings underline the unique importance of hMATE1 for the Imatinib uptake in hRASF. Open in a separate window Figure 3 hMATE1 mediates the Imatinib uptake in hRASF and governs anti-proliferating effects. A) Specific uptake of Imatinib (10 µM) in hRASF given as difference of accumulation at 4°C and 37°C with inhibition of hMATE1 (by 200 nM pyrimethamine), hOCT1 (by 20 µM MPP + ) or hOCTN1 (by 40 µM ergothioneine). Data are given as percentage of uptake without inhibition. B) Specific Imatinib uptake, hMATE1 Western Blot and PCR in hRASF after transfection with hMATE1- or scrambled (scr)-siRNA for 72 and 192 hours. Number of transfections is given in brackets. C) Proliferation on hRASF quantified by cell counting after stimulation with PDGF in the presence and absence of Imatinib and the hMATE1 inhibitor pyrimethamine with number of transfections given in brackets. All values are mean ± SEM. * indicates statistically significant effects (P\u003c0.05). To further address the relevance of this uptake for therapeutic effects, we investigated its impact on PDGF mediated proliferation in hRASF. As expected, incubation of naive hRASF with PDGF significantly increased cell proliferation by 67±6% (n = 12). Imatinib (2.5 µM) neutralized this effect to baseline proliferation levels ( Fig. 3C ). This effect of Imatinib was mostly abolished by co-incubation of naive hRASF with pyrimethamine (200 nM), which restored PDGF-induced cell proliferation (+42±9%, n = 12, Fig. 3C ). Pyrimethamine alone had no effect on hRASF proliferation (data not shown). Inflammatory Conditions Influence Imatinib Uptake and hMATE1 Expression in hRASF Since in RA afflicted joints the pH of the synovial fluid becomes acidic [13] , its influence on Imatinib uptake was analyzed. Indeed, the uptake in hRASF was pH dependent and decreased at an extracellular acidic pH ( Fig. 4A ). At pH 6.4 the specific Imatinib uptake was reduced by 85±1% (n = 3), confirming an involvement of a pH dependent transporter such as hMATE1 ( Fig. 4A ).

In this report, the cohort of Ph‐pos patients who received imatinib is reported separately. Details of the study eligibility, diagnostic procedures and treatment were previously described. 7 , 9 Data collection after relapse After relapse, following initial on‐protocol therapy, patients were followed up, but choice of therapy was left to the discretion of physician and patient.

COL1A1-PDGFB fusions are most commonly found in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) ( Takahira, 2007 ) and have only recently been reported in uterine sarcomas with fibrosarcomatous features. ( Grindstaff, 2020 , Croce, 2019 ) We reported the fourth case in the literature and the first showing a clinical response to Imatinib ( Grindstaff, 2020 ), a targeted therapy that has proven useful in treating unresectable DFSP ( Navarrete-Dechent, 2019 ). We would like to share the clinical follow-up in this case. The patient first presented for a gynecological examination, and on physical examination, an enlarged uterus was identified. An ultrasound was"

                    "Adjuvant chemotherapy led to longer survival among patients with early breast cancer. The fundamental principle of chemotherapy is to target dividing cells. However, efforts to use chemotherapy in patients with other types of cancer resulted in rare success and toxic effects. Breast cancer and prostate cancer, are furthermore susceptible to hormonal manipulation. Research efforts in CML led to a number of agents able to inhibit protein tyrosine kinases. Imatinib interfered with the viral oncogene v-abl and platelet-derived growth factor receptor activity in vitro and in mice. It also inhibited the growth of BCR-ABL–positive cells. Subsequently, Druker et al. reported data from phase I study in CML patients treated with imatinib; complete haematologic responses were seen in 53 of the 54 patients, and in 7 patients, the Philadelphia chromosome was no longer detectable. No other drug in oncology had achieved such results. A decade later, the IRIS study investigators report survival rate of 83% among patients in the imatinib group. In the course of the trial, 83% of the patients in the imatinib group had a complete cytogenetic response. Approximately one patient in five had a stable deep molecular response for 1 year or longer. Approximately 40% of the patients who stopped therapy remained in remission for 3 years or longer, with the rest having a relapse. Thus, imatinib is highly successful at controlling the disease in the long term, but few, if any, patients would be considered as cured. In the editorial article, Dan Longo wrote: “The development of imatinib fundamentally altered the field of oncology. Priorities shifted from agents that were active on dividing cells to understanding the biology of individual types of cancer. Once genetic analysis of tumors began, … the complexity gave rise to a revolution in cancer nosology.” Indeed, the analysis of cancers at the molecular"

(Image courtesy of Ahmed Alsaei) Like Gleevec, cisplatin is also an effective cancer drug, but there the resemblance ends. If Gleevec is a smart bomb, specifically targeting a genetic change that drives proliferation, cisplatin is a carpet-bombing campaign, attacking DNA in both healthy and malignant cells. But just as CML can develop resistance to Gleevec, solid tumors can become resistant to cisplatin. Looking for ways to overcome that resistance, Nawaf Al-Taweel of Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar is investigating other mechanisms by which cisplatin kills cancer cells.

We have investigated the capability to analyze simultaneously the parent drug and newly identified metabolites in patients' plasma by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The anticancer drug, imatinib, was chosen as a model drug because it has opened a new area in cancer therapy and is given orally and chronically. In addition, resistance and rare but sometimes severe side effects have been reported with this therapy. The quantification of imatinib and the profiling of its metabolites in plasma were established following three steps: (1) set-up of a generic sample extraction and LC-MS/MS conditions, (2) metabolite identification by LC-MS/MS using either in vitro incubations performed with human liver microsomes (HLMs) or patient plasma samples, (3) the simultaneous determination of plasma levels of imatinib and 14 metabolites in the plasma samples of 38 patients. Partial or cross method validation has been done and revealed that precise determinations of metabolite levels can be performed whereas pure standards are not available. Preliminary results indicate that the disposition of imatinib and its metabolites is related to interindividual variables and that outlier metabolite profiles can be revealed. This article underscores that, in addition to usual therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), LC-MS/MS methods can simultaneously record a complete drug metabolic profile enabling various correlation studies of clinical interest. \n        "

Reversion of the cardiac damage has been seldom reported, and thrombi can superimpose on infiltrated walls, originating oembolic complications. The tyrosine kynase inhibitor imatinib has been recently employed in patients affected by HES or EL, with impressive results. We have treated with imatinib a young patient affected by Loeffler's endocarditis during EL. Loeffler's endocarditis was studied by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography with and without the contrast agent SonoVue. Cytogenetics, FISH and molecular analysis showed the presence of the FIP1L1/PDGFRA fusion gene, recently detected in a majority of HES patients. Standard echocardiography revealed a large infiltration of the apical region, with apparently pedunculate corpora floating in the LV chamber; after SonoVue injection, a thick endo-myocardial infiltration involving papillary muscles and tendinous chords appeared, which simulated mobile thrombi at standard echography. Treatment with low dose imatinib caused rapid regression of both eosinophilic proliferation and endomyocardiopathy. The fusion gene FIP1L1-PDGFRA was found significantly decreased after a few months of treatment. Using a contrast echocardiographic approach, we demonstrated the non-thrombotic origin of the \"in plus\" image in our patient and its rapid resolution following imatinib treatment. Imatinib is an excellent candidate for first line treatment of Loeffler's endocarditis, especially when the FIP1L1/PDGFA fusion gene is detected. \n                               \n                            "

Notable successes that have resulted from this strategy include the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Gleevec (which blocks the BCRAbl gene fusion product) in the treatment of leukemias, and erlotinib and gefitinib (EGFR inhibitors) in the treatment of non–small cell lung cancers harboring activating EGFR mutations. 8 The clinical utility of these drugs has reinforced the notion that a more thorough understanding of the molecular networks"

No significant difference could be shown between the different PDGFRα mutations (PFS 2.1 months for D842V mutant and 7.8 months for other mutations, P = 0.2489). DISCUSSION Our two case patients with a non-D842V PDGFRα mutation responded or had prolonged periods of non-progressive disease to various tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Although patients with advanced disease and a PDGFRα mutation can respond to treatment with imatinib, the overall survival of these patients is worse than that of patients with a KIT mutation bearing GIST. This is reported in studies with advanced GIST patients where a median survival of 57 months for patients expressing KIT compared to a median overall survival of 23.7 months for patients with a PDGFRα mutation is reached [ 20 , 48 ]. Imatinib resistance was reported most frequently in GIST patients with PDGFRα mutations and wild type GISTs. However, the PDGFRα mutations were not specified [ 49 ]. In contrast to the mutation distribution described in literature of 10% PDGFRα mutations in GIST, most articles report a much lower fraction of patients with PDGFRα mutations, suggesting underreporting. To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding a p.M844_S847del variant in relation to TKI treatment. We show the clinical importance of mutation detection as patients with specific PDGFRα mutations respond well on imatinib treatment. The published reports that were found in the PubMed search provide limited PFS and OS data. However, patients with a non-D842V mutation have a favorable prognosis when treated with imatinib compared to patients with a D842V PDGFRα mutated GIST. A recent report showed a better overall survival in patients with non-D842V when treated with imatinib compared to patients with D842V mutated tumors [ 18 ]. Due to the latter it is of great importance to differentiate between those. The frequency of recurrence after surgery is lower in patients with gastric versus non-gastric PDGFRα mutated GIST, similar to patients with other mutations [ 50 ]. In"

Open in a separate window Figure 1 Metabolism of paracetamol glucuronidation by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and sulphation by sulphotransferase (SULT) are major metabolic pathways, and oxidation by cytochrome P450-2E1 (CYP2E1) is a minor metabolic pathway It is known that the glucuronidation pathway represents ∼60% of paracetamol metabolism [ 14 ] and imatinib competitively inhibits paracetamol O -glucuronidation with a K i value of 59 µ m . Inhibition of paracetamol glucuronidation by imatinib can result in shunt metabolism of paracetamol to other pathways. Thus, the present study was designed to examine the effect of imatinib on the plasma exposure of paracetamol and its major metabolites, paracetamol glucuronide and paracetamol sulphate. In addition, the present study also investigated the pharmacokinetic characteristics of imatinib (400 mg once daily) at steady state when co-administered with paracetamol at a dose of 1000 mg (once daily) in Korean patients with CML. Methods Patients Korean patients (≥18 and ≤75 years of age) with newly diagnosed, cytogenetically confirmed chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) CML, who were imatinib naïve, were eligible for this study. Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance status ≤3. Patients with significant hepatic, renal, respiratory or cardiac abnormalities were excluded. Study design This was an open-label, one-sequence study of 12 male and female patients with Ph+ early chronic phase CML. Patients received a single oral dose of paracetamol (1000 mg) on study day 1. On days 2–7, patients received an oral dose of imatinib (400 mg). Based on previous imatinib pharmacokinetic data [ 3 , 4 ], the accumulation half-life of imatinib is ∼17 h. Thus, imatinib reached steady state at day 7 of the study. On day 8, patients received imatinib (400 mg) together with paracetamol (1000 mg). The pharmacokinetics of imatinib have been widely studied in large CML populations. Race does not affect the pharmacokinetics of imatinib [ 3 , 4 ] and we have adequate data to support the pharmacokinetics of imatinib in the absence of paracetamol. Thus, imatinib concentrations were not measured in the absence of paracetamol. The study was conducted according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the study protocol was approved by the Independent Ethics Committee of Seoul St. Mary's Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to study enrolment."

Fourteen of the patients who achieved a complete molecular response or major molecular response with subsequent TKIs were in CP at the time of 2G-TKI discontinuation. Conclusion We conclude that treatment failure after first-line therapy with 2G-TKIs is mostly associated with toxicity or patient preference, and these patients respond well to alternative TKIs. \n Introduction Imatinib has been used as the standard first-line therapy for the management of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) for nearly a decade. With standard-dose imatinib, a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) is achieved in approximately 85% of CML patients, with a major molecular response (MMR) in approximately 60%. 1 – 7 However, more than 30% of patients do not have a favorable long-term outcome using imatinib, including 15% to 20% of patients who never achieve a CCyR, 10% to 15% who achieve CCyR but eventually lose it, and 4% to 8% who are intolerant to imatinib. 7 In view of this, second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib) were developed. These agents are more potent inhibitors of Bcr-Abl kinase activity and might overcome resistance by most Bcr-Abl mutants associated with resistance to imatinib. With these agents, CCyR is achieved in approximately 50% of patients in whom previous imatinib therapy had failed. 8 – 11 More recently, second-generation TKIs have been used as initial therapy for patients with CML in chronic phase (CP). 12 – 14 High rates of CCyR and MMR have been achieved at early time points, and randomized trials demonstrated improved response rates and decreased rate of transformation compared with imatinib. 15 – 17 Dasatinib and nilotinib have recently received regulatory approval for first-line therapy in chronic-phase CML. Despite the success of using these agents, in some patients therapy fails using second-generation TKIs as initial therapy. One concern about the widespread use of dasatinib and nilotinib as initial therapy is the"

                    "were analysed for KIT and PDGFRA mutations to investigate tumour mutation status at the end of the experiment. Sequencing confirmed that all xenografts had maintained the original mutation in KIT exon 11 (c.1673_1687del, p.Lys558_Glu562del) and in KIT exon 17 (c.2446G\u003e C, p.Asp816His). No further mutations were detected in KIT exons 9, 14 or 17, or in PDGFRA exons 12, 14 or 18. Discussion We explored the effects of imatinib administered either intermittently or continuously in a human GIST xenograft harbouring the D816H mutation, which is a mutation considered to cause clinical imatinib resistance in GIST patients. The results show that the tumours do not regress either with intermittent or continuous imatinib, but, notably, they grow at a substantially slower rate than untreated tumours. This finding suggests that GISTs with a KIT 11 deletion mutation coupled with a D816H substitution mutation are not entirely imatinib-resistant. From a clinical point of view this is potentially an important observation, since the KIT exon 11 deletion mutation is the most common mutation in GIST, and exon 17 point mutations are the most frequent mutations considered to confer imatinib resistance. In clinical practice, imatinib administration is often discontinued when advanced GIST stops to respond to imatinib, and alternative treatments such as sunitinib or other TKIs are instituted. Anecdotal clinical experience suggests that reinstitution of imatinib after failure of the second- or third-line TKI treatments may still slow down GIST progression compared to no systemic treatment. Although firm clinical evidence is lacking, reinstitution of imatinib may still be advantageous as the last-line palliative care [ 12 ]. The reason for imatinib benefit in the presence of D816H remains hypothetical. The KIT exon 11 deletion mutation, unlike the D816H mutation, continues to be sensitive to imatinib, which may results in a less active KIT kinase in the presence of imatinib as compared to a kinase where both mutations are uninhibited. If this hypothesis is correct, the present findings may have relevance to many GISTs with an imatinib-sensitive primary mutation and an imatinib-insensitive secondary mutation. The original primary mutation is virtually always present in GISTs that contain a secondary resistance mutation [ 11 ]. Of note, more than one secondary mutation are commonly found in tumours that grow during imatinib treatment, sometimes even within the same metastasis [ 19 ]. Our findings may thus lend support to rechallenge with imatinib, even in cases when multiple secondary resistance mutations are present, provided that the primary mutation is imatinib-sensitive. The French Sarcoma Group investigated in the randomised BRF14 trial the effect of interrupting imatinib treatment at after either one, three or five years of treatment in patients with advanced GIST who continued to respond to imatinib. Interruption of imatinib resulted in rapid GIST progression in the majority of patients, but almost all patients responded to imatinib reinstitution. No overall survival difference was seen between the interruption and the continuation groups, regardless of the timing of imatinib interruption [ 13 , 14 ]. Rapid cycling of imatinib administration (one week on, one week off) has not been tested in clinical trials, but the present result showed no benefits during the 91-day observation period. The AHAX xenograft model of human GIST has proven useful for studying 18 F-FDG uptake responses to TKIs [ 7 ]. In the current study we found differences in the dynamic 18 F-FDG uptake characteristics between the intermittent and the continuous treatment groups imaged while the mice were on imatinib. The TAC amplitude was higher in the intermittent group indicating either increased perfusion and/or increased metabolism compared to the continuous group. The tumour metabolic rate ( MR FDG ), in turn, was higher in the continuous group, whereas k 1 was higher and k 3 lower in the intermittent group"

NSC23766 also inhibited the growth of BCR-ABL-transformed cells, even those with the imatinib-resistant T315I mutation. 63 This Rac inhibitor may mobilize CML LSC cells from their niche, and thus inhibit the stem cell properties of these cells. Hence, this inhibitor, unlike others such as imatinib, may effectively target the LSC. Role of Src kinases in CML and ALL LSCs Imatinib has proven highly effective in the treatment of CML; however, it has been shown that imatinib, by itself, will not cure CML. This is often due to the development of resistance. Src and other signaling pathways are involved in resistance to imatinib. 64 , 65 Src family kinases are activated by BCR-ABL, and the inhibition of BCR-ABL by imatinib may not result in the complete inhibition of Src family kinases.

It is also active against a broad spectrum of Bcr-Abl mutations associated with resistance to Glivec(4). The first clinical trials of Tasigna began only 21 months after its discovery, with the drug receiving its first regulatory approval as a second-line treatment in 2007.   In its pivotal head-to-head trial against Glivec, Tasigna surpassed Glivec in key measures of treatment efficacy, as has been previously reported. Tasigna eliminated Bcr-Abl faster than Glivec, resulting in lower rates of cancer progression even as early as 12 months(1). Deep reduction of Bcr-Abl, known as a major molecular response, is considered to be a critical therapeutic milestone associated with good long-term outcomes for patients with Ph+ CML(5-7). Treatment with Tasigna led to higher rates of both major molecular response and complete cytogenetic response (elimination of the Philadelphia chromosome that is the hallmark of the cancer) compared with Glivec(1).   The randomized, open-label, multicenter ENESTnd trial compared the efficacy and safety of Tasigna versus Glivec in adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase(1). It is the   2   largest global randomized comparison of two oral therapies ever conducted in newly diagnosed Ph+ CML patients in chronic phase.   Two patients on the nilotinib arm progressed to either accelerated phase or blast crisis while 17 patients on the imatinib arm progressed to either accelerated phase or blast crisis. In the study, Tasigna was well tolerated.  Fewer patients discontinued due to adverse events from the Tasigna 300 mg twice daily arm of the study compared to the Glivec 400 mg once daily arm.  No patients in the study had a prolongation of the QT interval \u003e500 milliseconds(1). In addition, no sudden deaths occurred with either treatment(4).   Regulatory submissions for Tasigna in the first-line indication are under way worldwide, with applications currently filed in the EU, Switzerland and Japan.   About Tasigna(2) Tasigna has been approved in more than 80 countries for the treatment of chronic phase and accelerated phase Ph+ CML in adult patients resistant or intolerant to at least one prior therapy, including Glivec. The effectiveness of Tasigna for this indication is based on confirmed hematologic and unconfirmed cytogenetic response rates. There are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit, such as improvement in disease-related symptoms or increased survival.   Tasigna important safety information Because taking Tasigna with food may increase the amount of"

The activity of bosutinib, imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib against T315V, L248R, F317R, F359I, and L248R+F359I was assessed (Table I ). Table I. Activity of Imatinib, Bosutinib, Dasatinib, Nilotinib, Ponatinib, and DCC‐2036 Against Mutated Form of BCR/ABL The relative IC50 increase over wild type BCR/ABL (RR) was calculated. We classified RR values in four categories: sensitive (RR ≤ 2), moderately resistant (RR between 2 and 4), resistant (RR between 4 and 10), or highly resistant (RR\u003e10). In our experiments, T315V, L248R, and the double mutant L248R+F359I showed high resistance level to four TKIs (imatinib, bosutinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib). The single mutation F359I is highly resistant to nilotinib (RR 16.3), resistant to imatinib (RR 6.0) while it confers only moderate resistance to bosutinib and dasatinib (RR 2.9 and 3.0, respectively). F317R is moderately resistant to imatinib and nilotinib (RR 2.3) and highly resistant to bosutinib (RR 33.5) and dasatinib (RR 114.8).

( 1 ) present evidence that new modules appearing in preexisting lesions can represent clonally resistant populations. Imatinib mesylate, the prototypic oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has activity against ABL, KIT, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor kinases arguably represents the most important oncologic advance of the past 30 years. Imatinib has been shown to bind to the inactive conformations of ABL and KIT and presumably prevents these kinases from adopting the oncogenically relevant active conformation ( 2 , 3 ). The high response rates and favorable survival effect of imatinib in chronic phase cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), coupled with its excellent tolerability, have revolutionized the medical management of CML ( 4 ). The success of imatinib, however, is not limited to hematologic malignancies, as this agent has substantial efficacy in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) as well ( 5 , 6 ), a finding that has provided substantial hope for the application of kinase inhibitor therapy strategies to a broad range of human malignancies that carry poor prognoses. Despite high initial response rates to imatinib in both CML and GIST cases, for many patients, loss of response occurs. The molecular basis of loss of response to imatinib in CML most frequently involves reactivation of BCR-ABL kinase activity, typically as a result of selection for cells harboring kinase domain mutations within BCR-ABL ( 7 – 9 ). If sensitive methods of mutation detection are used, a substantial proportion of patients can be documented to exhibit polyclonal resistance (i.e., more than one resistant clonal population; ref. 9 ). Molecular analyses of GIST tumors that have developed resistance to imatinib have similarly implicated resistant kinase domain mutations in the activated KIT oncogene as a predominant mechanism of relapse, and a recent analysis has shown the evolution of polyclonal resistant clones in patients on imatinib therapy ( 10 ). The substantial number and variety of amino acid substitutions capable of abrogating imatinib binding poses a significant clinical challenge. In imatinib-resistant cases of both CML and GIST, substantial response rates (in CML) and superior progression-free survival (in GIST) have been observed with dasatinib ( 11 ) and sunitinib ( 12 ), respectively. These agents have been approved for sequential use (i.e., treatment after imatinib resistance or imatinib intolerance). It is postulated that early detection of resistant disease will facilitate prompt institution of effective second-line therapy and thereby maximize the likelihood of recapturing a durable clinical remission. Although monitoring disease burden in CML is easily achieved with the use of sensitive PCR testing to quantify BCR-ABL levels in"

Many authors concluded that hypophosphatemia comes from dysregulated bone metabolism (inhibition of osteoclastogenesis and osteoresorption) [ 3 , 7 ]. Hypophosphatemia and aminoaciduria are part of Fanconi syndrome due to proximal tubular dysfunction. We performed a prospective study to evaluate aminoaciduria before and under IM therapy and found that imatinib induces partial Fanconi syndrome with massive aminoaciduria confirming the role of proximal tubular dysfunction in hypophosphatemia. In this study, we included 20 consecutive patients with chronic phase CML. The initial characteristics of the patients are showed in Table I . Patients were tested for phosphocalcic metabolism and aminoacids concentrations, at"

The rates of MCyR and CCyR observed in this study with radotinib were generally higher than those seen in studies of other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This difference may be due to the patient population in this study; compared with other studies, patients in this study had a shorter duration of CML, had used lower doses of imatinib prior to study entry, and, taken together, had a smaller proportion of patients with mutation of BCR-ABL1. Moreover, according to European LeukemiaNet 2009 guidelines, 22 11 patients with suboptimal response to imatinib were included in this study; however, these patients would be considered to have treatment failure according to European LeukemiaNet 2013 guidelines. 25 Considering the limitations of this patient population, these data suggest the overall response rate with radotinib is comparable with other 2 nd -generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

The requirement of STAT5 in BCR-ABL1 + leukemias for transformation and disease maintenance has been well described [ 21 ]. Further, the role of the different STAT5A/B isoforms has recently been addressed, where in a BCR-ABL1 -inducible cellular system, knock-down of STAT5B sensitized leukemic cells to imatinib treatment [ 22 ] and the attenuation of STAT5A resulted in enhanced basal oxidative stress and DNA damage of normal CD34 + and CML cells as well as growth inhibition of CD34 + cells from patients with acquired imatinib resistance [ 23 ]. CML is a prototype of a myeloid neoplasm where a single driver mutant, BCR-ABL1, initiates activation of multiple pro-oncogenic signaling molecules, including STAT5 [ 24 ]. In the chronic phase of CML, BCR-ABL1 is essential for the survival and proliferation of leukemic cells. In line with"

Following this discovery, the first protein kinase inhibitors, known as naphthalene sulphonamides were synthesized. This led to further research and development until the first protein kinase inhibitor was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2001, known as imatinib or Gleevec. This medication is used to treat a number of cancers, such as for example chronic myeloid leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as well as several others.

Alternatively there is mutation/modification of the protein target/pathway. However, mutation in the eIF4E gene in studied cell lines was not observed. In contrast, Gleevec® or ATRA treatment can lead to mutations in Bcr-AbI and PML-RARA fusion proteins, respectively, which drive resistance.

In a broader sense, the present invention provides a method of treating GIST, preferably GIST not harboring any KIT mutations, including KIT mutations and KIT resistant muttions by administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a FGFR inhibitor. Furthermore, based on observations in GIST cell lines it was now surprisingly found that patients with GIST progressing after imatinib first line therapy, might be treated successfully with a combination comprising (a) a c-kit inhibitor and (b) a dual KIT inhibitor and FGFR inhibitor. Furthermore, it is concluded that patients with GIST progressing after consecutive therapy with imatinib and sunitinib can be treated successfully with a combination comprising (a) a c-kit inhibitor and (b) a dual KIT inhibitor and FGFR inhibitor. Hence, the present invention provides a method for treating GIST in a human patient progressing after imatinib therapy or consecutive imatinib and sunitinib therapy, comprising co-administration to said patient, e.g., concomitantly or in sequence, of a therapeutically effective amount of (a) a c-kit inhibitor and (b) a dual KIT inhibitor and FGFR inhibitor or FGFR inhibitor.

We used MarketScan commercial claims data (January 2011-June 2018) to identify patients with CML who newly initiated branded imatinib before 1 August 2015 or generic imatinib on or after 2 February 2016, and were continuously enrolled in health plans for 6 months before through 6 months following their initial fill. After inverse probability of treatment weighting, we compared adherence (proportion of days covered [PDC]) and persistence (no gaps ≥30 and ≥60 consecutive days in therapy) to TKI therapy. Patients initiating generic imatinib consistently had higher average PDC per month and over the 6-month follow-up period than initiators of branded imatinib. Average 6-month PDC was 92% (95%CI:89%-94%) for generic initiators and 85% (95%CI:83%-86%) for brand initiators. Compared with branded imatinib initiators, a larger proportion of generic imatinib initiators were adherent and persistent to TKI therapy (PDC ≥ 90%:78% versus 64%; no≥60-day gap:94% versus 86%). Patients initiating generic imatinib achieved clinically significant improvements in adherence to TKI therapy relative to branded drug users, presumably due to lower out-of-pocket costs. Given the importance of optimal adherence in CML, considering barriers to adherence (eg, patient-cost sharing and health benefit design) when selecting initial treatment may improve long-term medication adherence.

Recent studies showed that the imatinib has cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on many BCR/ABL-negative cancers. Numerous compounds with cytotoxic potential exert their functions by interfering with the DNA topoisomerase. In this study, we examined the effects of imatinib on tumour cell-killing in relation to DNA topoisomerase enzyme inhibition. We determined the cytotoxicity by cell proliferation assay (XTT; tetrazolium hydroxide), using the human K562 CML cells, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential by monitoring the changes in caspase-3 enzyme activity. Type I and II topoisomerase activities were measured by supercoiled plasmid relaxation and minicircle DNA decatenation assays respectively. Imatinib-induced apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. We also found that the imatinib was effective in both type I and type II topoisomerase reactions to a varying degree between 94% and 7% for the concentration range of 1 mm-0.02 mm in a dose-dependent manner. Our results suggest that the inhibition of topoisomerases may be a significant factor in imatinib-induced apoptosis in CML. \n"

KEYWORDS: GIST, miRSNP, SNP, miRNA sponge, epigenetics, imatinib, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, KIT, miR-221/222 Introduction Gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) emerged as a distinct disease entity after the identification of KIT and PDGFRA oncogenic mutations in GIST tumorigenesis in about 85–90% of cases [ 1 – 5 ]. The discovery of KIT / PDGFRA mutations led to the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with KIT inhibitory activity, such as imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib, which effectively bind to and inhibit KIT and PDGFRA oncogenic signalling, thereby impacting favourably in GIST patients survival [ 6 – 10 ].

We found that stromal cells express \u003e7-fold more PIGF than leukemia cells ( FIG. 7D ; p=0.003), which corroborates our preclinical data and extends the concept that PIGF is primarily produced by stromal cells in CML patients. Example 9 PIGF Levels in CML Patients Under Imatinib Remain Elevated It still remains unclear, why leukemia cells persist in patients treated with imatinib, which cause rapid relapse of most patients after withdrawal of the drug. The host stroma potentially plays an important role, independent of the BCR/ABL + leukemia cells. To elucidate, if imatinib can induce PIGF secretion by BMDSCs, we incubated stromal cells with increasing concentrations of imatinib. These experiments revealed dose-dependent induction of PIGF in murine BMDSCs indicating a potential role of stroma-derived PIGF in mediating resistance to imatinib. In order to elucidate whether this induction of PIGF in BMDSCs also occurs in vivo, we treated mice bearing CML induced by transplantation of BCR/ABL transduced bone marrow with imatinib and compared PIGF levels in their bone marrow with untreated leukemic mice and healthy mice. These experiments revealed upregulation of PIGF in the bone marrow of leukemic mice treated with imatinib compared to untreated mice, even though bone marrow infiltration of imatinib treated mice with leukemia cells was significantly lower ( FIG. 7E ) These results indicate potentiation of leukemia-induced PIGF expression in the bone marrow by imatinib, which might promote leukemia cell survival and proliferation in presence of imatinib. These findings prompted us to determine PIGF levels in the PB of patients treated with Imatinib reaching different response levels (complete molecular remission CMR; BCR/ABL/ABL ratio \u003c1; BCR/ABL/ABL ratio \u003c10) and to compare them to healthy individuals and untreated, primarily diagnosed CML patients. Interestingly, PIGF levels were significantly higher in patients with CMR than in healthy subjects, and in patients with a low BCR/ABL/ABL ratio \u003c1, PIGF was elevated to similar levels as in untreated, newly diagnosed CML patients ( FIG. 7F ). These data indicate that PIGF remains elevated despite reduction of leukemic burden by several orders of magnitude and might contribute to persistence of disease under treatment with Imatinib. In conclusion, our data indicate that PIGF represents a stromal derived factor promoting the progression of Ph+ leukemia, independent of BCR/ABL mutational status, and represents a novel target produced by the leukemic stroma, useful adjunct to BCR/ABL kinase inhibitors or in TKI refractory leukemia. Discussion Introduction of Imatinib and second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors has revolutionized treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) leukemias, but leukemia cells persist even in successfully treated patients, and some patients develop resistance and ultimately relapse. The reasons for these drawbacks are not entirely resolved, but it was postulated by us that the host"

Many preclinical studies have showed the effectiveness of targeted small molecule inhibitors in killing cancer cells or preventing tumor growth. Examples include Imatinib Mesylate for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and Gefitinib for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer.

On the other hand, sorafenib specifically inhibited BCR/ABL–dependent phosphorylation of various cellular substrates and directly inhibited the kinase activity of BCR/ABL in in vitro kinase assays ( Fig. 6 ). Therefore, the present study strongly suggests that inhibition of the BCR/ABL kinase activity by sorafenib should play an essential role in the induction of apoptosis in BCR/ABL–driven cells. As compared with imatinib, however, sorafenib less efficiently and only moderately inhibited the BCR/ABL kinase activity while inducing significant apoptosis in these cells. It is thus speculated that the inhibition of BCR/ABL by sorafenib may act cooperatively with other BCR/ABL–independent effects of sorafenib, including those discussed above, to induce apoptosis effectively in BCR/ABL–driven cells."

A compelling example is the use of small molecule drugs, such as imatinib (Gleevec), which inhibit the KIT tyrosine kinase in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Assays are needed to determine which inhibitor is most effective at silencing the KIT kinase in each GIST patient. The aim of this study was to develop a robust, cytology-based assay to measure tumor susceptibility to target-specific small molecule inhibitors. We created an immortal GIST cell line (GIST882) that was treated in vitro with several inhibitors of the KIT --\u003e AKT --\u003e mTOR --\u003e S6 signaling pathway. KIT was inhibited with imatinib, and mTOR with RAD001. Treatment response was assessed in cytologic preparations by immunocytochemical staining with antibodies to KIT, phospho-KIT, phospho-AKT, and phospho-S6. Optimization was performed to maximize staining in the absence of inhibitor, and minimize staining in the presence of inhibitor. GIST882 cells demonstrated strong, robust phospho-S6 expression in the absence of inhibitor. This expression was completely inhibited by treatment with upstream signaling pathway inhibitors (imatinib and RAD001). Other phospho-specific antibodies had weaker baseline reactivity in the absence of inhibitor. The accuracy of the immunocytochemical results on the cytologic preparations was validated by immunoblotting studies. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of cytologic methods to monitor labile biochemical responses in tumor cells during drug therapy. Such approaches"

This status of molecular remission in the peripheral blood has now been confirmed several times over a period spanning more than 250 days and it is hoped that it will be durable in the future. It is known that imatinib mesylate can induce cytogenetic remission in advanced CML. Yet, only a minority of patients with advanced CML enjoy complete cytogenetic responses or hematologic responses that are durable beyond 1 year. In addition, molecular responses to imatinib mesylate are rare in patients with chronic phase or more advanced CML. Thus, while it cannot be excluded that the complete hematological, cytogenetic and molecular response in this patient was achieved by the sole action of imatinib mesylate, one could speculate that reduction of the disease burden by imatinib mesylate has created a window of opportunity for an alloreactive graft-versus-leukemia effect. Of note, imatinib mesylate has been reported to augment the function of antigen-presenting cells; as such it may also facilitate GVH reactivity and GVL effects. Finally, despite low blood counts and peripheral blood donor chimerism at the start of imatinib, improved graft function was achieved without the need for a second infusion of donor hematopoietic stem cells. In summary, this case indicates that imatinib mesylate can be highly efficient in treating persisting CML after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The observations also suggest that imatinib mesylate may promote or synergize with the graft-versus-leukemia effect after transplantation. More data are awaited to better define the role of imatinib mesylate after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. PV is a Clinical Investigator of Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Vlaanderen.

In the only published report, 48.1% of BRCA1 -associated tumors were c-kit positive [ 31 ]. The difference may be explained by a low number of cases ( n  = 27), different cut-off level applied to distinguish positive vs. negative cases (authors did not specify it) and different antibody used. Imatinib has proven to be an efficient anti-c-kit-targeted therapy for gastrointestinal stromal tumors; however, little is known about the results of such therapy in breast cancer, and nothing is known about it in BRCA1 -associated breast cancer, so the clinical value of c-kit therapy in patients with c-kit positive BRCA1 -associated carcinomas has yet to be established. Our finding that about 15% of BRCA1 -associated breast cancers express c-kit may help in the proper recruitment of patients for future prospective clinical trials because only those cancers may serve as a target for therapy with imatinib. In Table  4 , the results of our study are compared with major reports in the literature on the immunohistochemical assessment of ER/PR, HER-2, EGFR, and c-kit in BRCA1 -associated breast carcinomas.

In the future, a whole molecular characterization of PDGFRA mutants other than D842V, coupled with protein-ligand interaction modelling, could help to build a more representative molecular signature of this rare subgroup of GIST 18 . Conclusions In conclusion, the His845_Asn848delinsPro exon 18 PDGFRA mutation, even if rare, has clinical importance because it is sensitive to imatinib, and that sensitivity, already shown in vitro , is likely affected by the conformation of the receptor.

Another potent and selective inhibitor of MEK, AZD6244, has demonstrated activity against BRAF-mutant melanoma both in vitro and in vivo. It has completed phase I testing and is currently being evaluated in a randomized phase II trial in advanced melanoma. KIT inhibitors The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, potently inhibits KIT and has been approved for treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( Schnadig and Blanke 2006 ) and chronic myleogenous leukemia, as described above. In two Phase II studies of 26 and 18 metastatic melanoma patients, respectively, imatinib mesylate showed little clinical efficacy ( Ugurel et al 2005 ; Wyman et al 2006 ). However, based on the recognition that acral lentiginous and mucosal melanomas frequently harbor amplifications or mutations of KIT, a Phase II trial of imatinib mesylate (NIH Clinical Trial number NCT00424515 ) has been initiated for patients with these subtypes of melanoma. Conclusion The dramatic successes achieved with targeted therapies in some cancers, notably imatinib mesylate in chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, have not been observed in melanoma. However, there are myriad new agents targeting the MAP kinase pathways either in preclinical development or in clinical trials. Agents targeting BRAF and MEK will undoubtedly continue to undergo intensive evaluation in clinical trials for melanoma"

Meanwhile, the discovery that pharmacological inhibitors can inhibit a specific tyrosine kinase made it possible to develop small molecule drugs for cancers in which tyrosine kinase activity plays an important role ( Yaish et al., 1988 ). Recently, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor – imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, also known as STI571) – that is specific for the ABL, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor and KIT tyrosine kinases was developed ( Buchdunger et al., 1996 ; Druker et al., 1996 ; Heinrich et al., 2000 ). Preclinical experiments and clinical trials have shown that imatinib was very effective in treating CML (reviewed in Druker et al., 2001 ). As an example, a recent multi-institutional phase 2 study showed that greater than 90% of imatinib-treated IFN-α-resistant CML patients in chronic phase had a complete hematologic response, and more than 40% had a complete cytogenetic response (defined as 0% Philadelphia-chromosome (Ph)-positive cells in metaphase in bone marrow ( Kantarjian et al., 2002 ). Like a ‘smart bomb’, this mechanism-based drug also causes much less ‘collateral damage’ (side effects) in patients. As a result, imatinib has rapidly become a new standard treatment for CML that is refractory to interferon therapy. The long-term benefits of the imatinib-treatment for CML are not yet known. Clinical trials have shown that drug resistance developed quickly in imatinib-treated CML patients in blast phase, largely due to gene amplification or mutations"

                    "Donato, Ph.D., of the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center in Ann Arbor and others suggested that one possible mechanism of this mutation-negative resistance is the activation of LYN kinase, which is normally controlled by BCR-ABL in CML cells. In the current study, Donato and colleagues have expanded that work and examined the impact of overexpression and gene silencing of LYN kinase in CML cell lines treated with imatinib. They also determined the level of LYN activation in samples from 12 imatinib-resistant patients who lacked BCR-ABL mutations and 6 patients whose tumor cells were sensitive to the drug but who were unable to tolerate its side effects. They found that overexpression and activation of LYN kinase was associated with imatinib resistance in both cell lines and patient samples. Moreover, when they treated these cells with imatinib, they saw that BCR-ABL activity was suppressed as happens in CML cells sensitive to the drug, but LYN activation was not suppressed. When the researchers blocked expression of the LYN gene in the resistant cells, they restored imatinib responsiveness and triggered cell death. \"These studies expand the spectrum of cellular changes that occur during imatinib therapy beyond outgrowth of cells with BCR-ABL point mutations and support the use of other tyrosine kinase inhibitors to treat a broad spectrum of imatinib-resistant CML patients,\" the authors write.

Our present genetic studies identified non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl as an important regulator of the muscularis propria homeostasis and a risk factor for rectal prolapse. Mouse deficient for c-Abl showed defects in the muscularis propria of gastrointestinal tract and older c-Abl (-/-) mice developed megaesophagus and rectal prolapse. Inhibition of c-Abl with imatinib mesylate, an anti-CML drug, or ablation of c-Abl using Prx1-Cre, which marks smooth muscle cells, recapitulated most of the muscularis propria phenotypes. The pathogenesis of rectal prolapse was attributable to overproliferation of smooth muscle cells, which was caused by enhanced ERK1/2 activation. Administration of ERK inhibitor U0126 impeded the development of rectal prolapse in c-Abl deficient mice. These results reveal a role for c-Abl-regulated smooth muscle proliferation in the pathogenesis of rectal prolapse, and imply that long-term use of imatinib mesylate may cause gastrointestinal problems in patients while ERK inhibitor may be effective in treating rectal prolapse.

Subpart H approval is a federally mandated approval process reserved for life-threatening diseases in which a single study using surrogate endpoints can be used for approval. In oncology, subpart H strategies typically involve using response rates (tumor shrinkage) as the major endpoint of a study instead of the more traditional survival analysis generally used.      Novartis used a subpart H strategy for the approval of Gleevec. Novartis used cytogenetic response to imatinib as the surrogate marker of drug efficacy for Gleevec. Bristol-Myers Squibb also used a subpart H strategy for the approval of dasatinib. We believe that INNO-406 can be approved using the same approach for CML patients that are intolerant to dasatinib and nilotinib. If we are successful in our subpart H regulatory strategy, we believe that conditional U.S. marketing approval for INNO-406 can be obtained in 2008. In addition, we also believe we can gain approval in Gleevec resistant patients by demonstrating similar efficacy and an improved adverse event profile versus dasatinib. Any approval of INNO-406 will be dependent on whether we can prove its safety and efficacy.      Phase I Study. Our Phase I clinical study uses a modified continual dose reassessment method at seven sites in the U.S., Germany and Israel.

                    "mutation incidence between disease phases leads to several considerations. On one hand, it points toward advanced-phase CML and Ph+ ALL cases as patients at high risk of emergence of resistance-associated mutant clones. There are currently no published data supporting the evidence that a systematic screening allowing for an early detection of emergent kinase domain mutations is more beneficial than examining ABL sequences only in case overt resistance to imatinib is observed. However, our data suggest that, at least in the setting of advanced-phase CML or Ph+ ALL patients, it might be worth assessing—ideally in the context of a prospective study—whether a regular mutation monitoring may assist clinicians in treatment optimization. On the other hand, the evidence that mutations in chronic-phase patients account for approximately a quarter of resistant cases only highlights the need to find out which is the actual predominant mechanism(s) of resistance acting in this setting, which now gathers the overwhelming majority of CML patients on imatinib therapy. BCR-ABL gene amplification and additional chromosomal aberrations are also known to be associated with imatinib resistance ( 9 11 ); however, they seem to play a role mainly in advanced CML phases. Point mutations in BCR or ABL regions other than the kinase domain have been hypothesized based on the results of an in vitro saturation mutagenesis screening for mutations conferring resistance to imatinib ( 25 ) and on the assumption that any amino acid substitution favoring the active conformation of BCR-ABL (to which imatinib is unable to bind) may confer resistance; this, however, have not been described in patients as yet. Overexpression of drug transporters, such as hOCT1, has recently been reported in some chronic-phase patients with primary cytogenetic resistance ( 26 ) and is an issue that deserves further elucidation. Among chronic-phase patients, however, mutation incidence in those who had received imatinib after α-IFN failure was approximately twice as high as in those who had received imatinib as first-line therapy (31% versus 14%). Such an intriguing difference between early and late chronic phase supports the hypothesis that mutations tend to accumulate during the natural course of the disease as a result of a progressively increasing genetic instability and are therefore a feature of CML clinical deterioration and not necessarily a phenomenon observed only against a background of imatinib exposure. This would fit with the recent observation that kinase domain mutations may be detected in a substantial fraction of imatinib-naïve patients with advanced-phase CML ( 27 ). Although there were 17 codons affected by mutations and the relative frequencies of each single amino acid substitution were consequently low, we"

All patients who lost a MR 4.5 remained in MR 4 throughout the study. The results of our short, 1‐year observation suggest that molecular and cytogenetic response rates and AEs rates on imatinib generics and branded imatinib are alike when used in the upfront setting, as well as when used subsequently. Because of the relatively short period of observation, the same conclusions cannot be made for overall survival, for treatment‐free survival, and for late or unexpected side‐effects. The long‐term use of imatinib generics will provide more solid prospective data.

The optimal duration of treatment with imatinib mesylate inGIST has not yet been established, as durable remissions have been observed in patients. It is, therefore, important todevelop strategies to deal with common side-effects of what may be a long-term treatment. Here we report the case of apatient with advanced GIST who developed a cutaneous drug reaction secondary to imatinib mesylate and the variousmanagement options that may be employed depending upon the severity of the toxicity.

Soon after the identification of KIT mutations in melanoma, two case reports ( Hodi et al ., 2008 ; Lutzky et al ., 2008 ) quickly established the potential promise of KIT-targeted therapy in these patients, and two Phase II studies evaluating imatinib in the context of KIT -mutated metastatic melanoma have further explored this possibility ( Carvajal et al ., 2011 ; Guo et al ., 2011 ). In the Carvajal trial, the authors showed a 16% overall durable response rate (median OS of 46.3 weeks), with the better response rates occurring in cases with mutations affecting recurrent hotspots (c-KIT K642E or c-KIT L576P ) or with a mutant-to-wild type allelic ratio of more than 1—significance measure of potential KIT dependence. In the Guo trial, 43 patients were treated with 400mg per day imatinib and experienced a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 3.5 months with a 6-month PFS rate of 36.6%. Eighteen patients (41.9%) demonstrated shrinkage of tumor mass, and the 1-year OS rate was 51.0%. These studies confirm the potential clinical utility of c-KIT suppression, although the full effects require Phase III trials."

Relative levels of Chk1-S345P, determined by densitometric analysis, are shown. ( C ) 32Dp210 cells were cultured for 16 h with 1 µM etoposide alone (Cont.) or also with 1 µM imatinib and 1 µM GSK3-I #5 (GSK3-I), as indicated, and analyzed for the cellular DNA content. ( D ) 32Dp210 cells were pretreated for 1 h with 1 µM imatinib, 1 µM GSK3-I #5, or 5 µM MG132, as indicated, or left untreated (Cont.). Cells were then treated with 1 µM etoposide for indicated times and analyzed by Western blot analysis. We next examined the involvement of GSK3 in regulation of Chk1 activation in BCR/ABL-expressing cells. As shown in Fig. 5C , GSK3-I #5 prevented apoptosis induced in 32Dp210 cells by the combined treatment with etoposide and imatinib. Furthermore, the GSK3 inhibitor also prevented at least partly the inhibition of etoposide-induced Chk1 activation by imatinib in 32Dp210 cells ( Fig. 5D ). Because Chk1 is degraded through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway [11] , we also examined the effect of a proteasome inhibitor, MG132. MG132 suppressed the inhibition of Chk1 activation similarly with GSK3-I #5 and prevented a slight decline in its expression level by imatinib in etoposide-treated 32Dp210 cells ( Fig. 5D ). Thus, proteasomal degradation of Chk1 as well as GSK3 activation may be involved in negative regulation of etoposide-induced Chk1 by imatinib in these cells. To confirm the involvement of Akt upstream of GSK3 in regulation of Chk1 activation, we examined 32Dp210 cells engineered to express a constitutively activated Akt1 mutant, Akt1-myr. As shown in Fig. 6A , Akt1-myr prevented the synergistic induction of apoptosis by imatinib in etoposide-treated cells and retained the cells in the G2/M phase. We next confirmed the involvement of PI3K and Akt by using their specific inhibitors GDC-0941 and MK-2206, respectively, which are currently under clinical studies [25] – [29] .

Representative blots are shown. Actin is included as a loading control. ( C ) Ki-67 expression was evaluated by FACS prior to and following 4-hour culture with or without 5 μM imatinib. ( D ) Lin – cells stained with CFSE and cultured for 72 hours with 5 μM imatinib were analyzed for Ki-67 expression. Ki-67 expression is shown in undivided (CFSE hi ) cells and in cells having undergone 1 or more divisions (CFSE lo/mod ). ( E ) Phospho-CRKL immunoblots of quiescent versus cycling cells treated 4 hours with or without imatinib are shown for 2 newly diagnosed CML samples. Total CRKL is included as a loading control. Cytokine supplementation supports in vitro proliferation and differentiation of CML stem and progenitor cells despite continuous inhibition of BCR-ABL by imatinib. Given that imatinib inhibited BCR-ABL activity in CML stem cells, committed progenitors, and quiescent progenitors, we evaluated how inhibition of BCR-ABL activity affects the capacity of these cell types to survive and proliferate. Previous studies indicated that CML CD34 + cells exhibit limited cytokine-independent growth that is inhibited by imatinib ( 19 ). In agreement with these data, we found that short-term in vitro proliferation of Lin – CML cells in the absence of cytokines, serum, and stromal support depended entirely on BCR-ABL activity, with growth curves similar to those of normal cells cultured under identical conditions (Figure (Figure4A). 4 A). Although some CML cells survived 4-day culture in the presence of imatinib, the majority of the cells were apoptotic, as were normal cells under the same conditions (Figure (Figure4B). 4 B). Therefore, in the absence of external supportive factors, CML progenitors require BCR-ABL activity for cytokine-independent survival and proliferation and behave similarly to phenotypically matched normal controls upon inhibition of BCR-ABL. Open in a separate window Figure 4 Proliferation and survival of CML progenitor cells in short-term imatinib culture. ( A ) Cell numbers of newly diagnosed CML or normal Lin – cells with or without imatinib were monitored daily during a 4-day culture in the absence of cytokines or in the presence of a cytokine cocktail that included SCF, FLT3 ligand, GCSF, IL-3, and IL-6. Normalized cell counts (mean ± SEM) are plotted for CML ( n = 10) and normal ( n = 6) cells treated or not with 5 μM imatinib. ( B ) Apoptosis in untreated versus imatinib cultures was evaluated by annexin-V staining ( n = 3, CML and normal). Mean ± SEM on day 4 is shown for cultures with no cytokines and the 5-cytokine cocktail. Moreover, imatinib-treated CML cells costained with annexin-V, Lin cocktail, CD34, and CD38 on day 4 ( n = 3) showed differing apoptosis frequencies in different cell types. ( C ) Percent BCR-ABL + cells were determined by FISH following culture with or without 5 μM imatinib. ( D ) Fold expansion of Lin – cells ( n = 3, CML and normal) with or without imatinib was evaluated following a 4-day culture in a cytokine cocktail that was serially diluted relative to the conditions in A . Error bars represent SEM. We next evaluated proliferation of Lin – CML cells from newly diagnosed patients during a 4-day culture period in the presence of a 5-cytokine cocktail that included 100 ng/ml SCF, 100 ng/ml FLT3 ligand, 20 ng/ml G-CSF, 20 ng/ml IL-3, and 20 ng/ml IL-6. CML cells demonstrated a proliferative advantage relative to normal cells that was suppressed by imatinib (Figure (Figure4A). 4 A). Untreated CML Lin – cells expanded 9.4-fold on average, while imatinib-treated CML cells and imatinib-treated normal cells expanded to the same degree (4.0-fold versus 4.8-fold, P = 0.14). Treatment with imatinib did not significantly inhibit expansion of normal cells ( P = 0.3). Consistent with published data ( 38 , 39 ), we observed only a modest increase in apoptosis in imatinib-treated cultures that was largely limited to CD34 + CD38 + and Lin + cells (Figure (Figure4B). 4 B). FISH for BCR-ABL following the culture period demonstrated that in all samples, greater than 95% of cells were Ph + regardless of the presence of imatinib (Figure (Figure4C), 4 C), demonstrating that imatinib did not select normal progenitors. Given that the concentrations of cytokines used in our assay were in excess of expected normal concentrations in the bone marrow, we serially diluted our initial cytokine cocktail to evaluate fold expansion of imatinib-treated CML Lin – cells and normal counterparts under more physiologically relevant"

GISTs are more frequently found in stomach (~50%), followed by small intestine (25%), colon/rectum (5%–10%), and esophagus (5%). 1 The mean age of presentation of GIST is between 50 and 70 years, although it can be diagnosed at any age. 2 Surgical resection followed by adjuvant Imatinib mesylate (Glivec ® ; Novartis Pharma, Basel, Switzerland) in selected cases is the treatment of choice for GISTs. In metastatic setting (between 15% and 50% of patients develop metastases), GIST represents one of the paradigms of targeted agents era. 3 Initially, median survival for patients with advanced disease was around 10–18 months because no effective therapies were available. 2 However, after discovering the role of stem cell factor receptor (KIT) gene mutations in the pathogenesis of GIST and the consequent introduction of KIT inhibitor imatinib in GIST treatment dramatically improved the prognosis of these patients. The KIT, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) and ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib at doses of 400 mg daily until progression of disease and/or unacceptable toxicity is the standard first-line treatment in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST. Imatinib was approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after the results of a phase II trial in which \u003e60% of patients experimented partial responses (PRs) to imatinib and some of them maintained the benefit for a long period of time. 4 Imatinib is supposed to be the first step in advanced GIST treatment, but further investigation is required given that between 10% and 15% of GISTs are primary resistant to imatinib, 50% develop secondary resistance within 2 years of imatinib initiation and ~4% of GIST patients are intolerant to imatinib. 5 Sunitinib malate (Sutent ® ; Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) was approved by regulatory entities after disease progression or intolerance to imatinib in 2006, which is the objective of this review. Recently, another multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) regorafenib (Stirvarga; Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc; Montville, NJ, USA) has been approved after failure or intolerance to imatinib and sunitinib. The recommended dose is 160 mg taken orally once per day for the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle. After promising results of a phase II trial, 6 the pivotal trial that leads to regorafenib approval was an international, randomized (2:1), placebo-controlled, multicenter phase III trial (the"

Researchers have since used this knowledge, in an attempt to treat TSGCT. In 2008, Blay et al 30 reported a complete remission in a 34-year-old female, with recurrent right elbow TSGCT treated with imatinib. Based on this report, Snoots et al 31 attempted the same approach on a 35- year-old male with recurrent hip TSGCT and observed a stable reduction in tumour size.

In particular, the TKI imatinib mesylate (IM) and new generations of TKIs, which specifically target the kinase activity of BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), have transformed CML from a fatal disease to a manageable disease [ 1 ].

Dinara Makenbaeva, Group Director, Worldwide Health Economics and Outcomes Research Communications Lead, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ. The approval of imatinib (Gleevec) in May 2001 was a clinical breakthrough and provided an opportunity for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who responded to the drug to achieve a cure. Managed care plans then looked at this cancer type as a chronic disease that required the long-term management of patients. The $26,000 annual price tag for the branded imatinib was concerning at the time, because it represented a very high-cost oral therapy in the oncology space that had a significant budget impact on health plans. Despite its high cost, all health plans covered Gleevec, with utilization management targeting the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s approved indication for CML, and additional indications were added per the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines or as approved by the FDA. DRUGMAKERS: The launch of the generic version of imatinib on February 1, 2016, was also met with great excitement, because the cost of the branded version had risen to approximately $120,000 annually by then. Sun Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of genetic imatinib, priced the generic agent within 10% of the brand-name drug's price, and imatinib became the first generic drug to launch with a 6-month exclusivity period per the FDA's rules. This pricing was consistent with typical generic drug pricing in the market; a first-to-launch company recoups the largest share of its drug development and marketing costs in the first 6 to 12 months after"

Chromosomal abnormalities in Ph-negative cells Haifa-Kathrin Al-Ali Haifa-Kathrin Al-Ali Thomas Bumm Thomas Bumm Christel Müller Christel Müller Patricia Shepherd Patricia Shepherd Dietger Niederwieser Dietger Niederwieser Knut Krohn Knut Krohn Michael W. N. Deininger Michael W. N. Deininger Several case reports and small studies have appeared that describe clonal cytogenetic abnormalities in Ph-negative cells of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated with imatinib. Trisomy 8 and monosomy 7 are most frequent, but other aberrations have also been reported. 1 The cases published thus far were in late chronic or accelerated phase. Thus, the patient described by McMullin et al is unusual, since he had received only a short course of hydrea prior to imatinib. To our knowledge, there is only one similar published case. This patient exhibited t(2;11) both in Ph-negative and Ph-positive cells, implying that this aberration was present before the Philadelphia translocation was acquired, 2 in contrast to the case of McMullin et al, where the abnormalities were confined to Ph-negative cells. One of the main issues raised by these observations is whether imatinib has a direct mutagenic effect. Preclinical studies showed that imatinib and some of its intermediates are genotoxic in vitro. 3 In vivo effects of intermediates can be excluded, since they are not present at relevant concentrations in the purified drug. Clastogenic effects of imatinib occurred in only one in vitro chromosome aberration assay at the highest concentration (125 mg/L), which is highly cytotoxic and exceeds drug levels achieved in patients by several orders of magnitude. 4 Effects such as this are not unusual and known as high-toxicity clastogenicity (J. Ford and D. Roman, personal written communication, July 2003). In addition, in our study, 5 we observed an association between chromosomal abnormalities in Ph-negative cells and prior exposure to cytarabine and idarubicin, arguing against a direct genotoxic effect of imatinib. Moreover, if imatinib was directly genotoxic, one would expect a similar incidence in newly diagnosed patients after comparable follow-up. The median time on imatinib in the patients with abnormalities in our study was 16 months. 5 This is shorter than the 19 months median follow-up in the randomized comparison of imatinib versus interferon-alpha/cytarabine in newly diagnosed patients. 6 Since abnormalities in Ph-negative cells were not specifically captured in this study, underreporting cannot be excluded. However, an incidence of 15% as in our study would hardly have gone undetected. Thus, it seems likely that the proliferative stress placed on a small number of Ph-negative stem cells to restore hematopoiesis in the presence of imatinib may be more important. In this case, patients whose disease has evolved over a longer period of time before diagnosis will be at higher risk, due to their smaller pool of Ph-negative progenitor cells. The patient described by McMullin et al did not achieve a major cytogenetic response until 12"

To determine whether BTK expression modulates sensitivity to ABL inhibitors, the same cell lines were exposed to graded concentrations of imatinib. Downregulation of BTK did not affect cell proliferation or viability in the presence of imatinib compared to cells infected with scrambled shRNA ( Figures 1b and c ). Identical experiments were performed on Ba/F3 cells expressing E255K and T315I mutants of Bcr-Abl, with similar results ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). These data suggest that BTK is neither required for proliferation of Bcr-Abl-positive cells nor does it modulate the response to imatinib.

Resistance can occur because of mutations that render the drug target insensitive to the inhibitor or when cancer cells change their dependency on the pathway that is targeted. In the first example, resistance can be overcome by developing new drugs that effectively inhibit resistance-associated mutants, as in the example of dasatinib and nilotinib which are effective on BCR-ABL mutants that confer resistance to imatinib. A second approach is to target multiple signaling pathways simultaneously, and thus prevent the cancer from changing its dependency to another significant pathway, for example combining inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) kinase with inhibitors of PI3 kinase. The third approach is to enhance efficacy of the"

The most important mechanisms known to cause resistance are point mutations in the ABL tyrosine kinase and the ATP domain. This study describes the use of denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) as a method to screen for mutations of the ABL gene.Material and Methods: We used the dHPLC based assay for the screening of ABL point mutations. Forty chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients who showed resistance to imatinib were screened in parallel by dHPLC and direct sequencing.Results: Nine of the 40 patients (23%) had mutations. Conclusion: dHPLC can be a useful method for pre-screening. Analyzing the mutations and monitoring (high-risk) patients can improve their prognosis and survival rate. dHPLC can potentially become a valuable tool for regular testing"

The advent of BCR‐ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) from the end of the 20th century onward has revolutionized CML prognosis, beginning with the introduction of imatinib. Nowadays, allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is solely used as a last resort salvage option and interferon‐α (IFN) is hardly prescribed anymore with few exceptions, such as during pregnancy or in the setting of combination therapy trials together with TKIs. Adult patients with CP‐CML who optimally respond to imatinib or next generation TKIs have a near‐normal life expectancy and, in this population, the impact of comorbidities on survival outcomes is considered as greater than that of CML itself (Saussele et al , 2015 ; Bower et al , 2016 ).

The transcript of FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene is a genetic biomarker of clonal eosinophilia screened routinely by reverse transcript PCR (RT-PCR) during diagnosis. Another significant genetic biomarker is the PDGFRA gene alone as some of its mutations are targets of imatinib. In this study, we identified a patient who had typical symptoms of Eosinophilia but had no response to the first-line treatment of hormonotherapy. This patient also showed bone rupture and eosinophil bone infiltration, which are extremely rare among all known eosinophilia patients. We identified the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene via RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Using next generation sequencing (NGS), we detected point mutations in PDGFRA, MYOM2, and ASXL3. The patient then received imatinib therapy, leading to the complete disappearance of FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene and mutated MYOM2. The level of PDGFRA point mutation was also decreased from pre-treatment: 57.86% down to 42.99% at 6 months and to 38.80% at one-year after treatment. The level of ASXL3 mutations did not change significantly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case in which the point mutation of PDGFRA has been identified at p.P6L in exon 2, likely making it sensitive to imatinib and thus should be further studied as a potential new molecular target of imatinib therapy. \n                               \n                                                                "

Because the definition of AP varies among studies, comparisons of outcome and prognosis are difficult.

Treatment with interferon-alfa (IFNalpha)-based therapy is ineffective for most patients in AP and for all of those in BP. Imatinib mesylate has demonstrated significant activity AP and BP disease, although the results are inferior compared to treatment in CP. In AP, 82% of patients achieve a hematologic response, with 24% achieving a major cytogenetic remission (MCR). Early MCR (within 3 months of diagnosis) provides a survival advantage over patients who do not achieve this response or achieve it later.

In GISTs, the presence of exons 9–11 c-KIT mutations is usually associated with the response to imatinib, an inhibitor of tyrosine-kinases like KIT, PDGFRA, ABL, and Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), and of colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R). 17 On the other hand, some acquired KIT mutations are responsible for imatinib resistance, such as exon 17–18 mutations, which activate the loop domain of the receptor. 18 KIT alterations, such as mutations or amplifications, are rare in cutaneous melanoma, but relatively frequent in mucosal melanoma, particularly in vulvar–vaginal melanoma, where they are present in 20–44% of analyzed specimens. 16 , 19 In several phase II trials, imatinib proved effective in patients with metastatic melanoma mostly harboring JM KIT point mutations, with an ORR (complete + partial remission) ranging from 5 to 29%. 20 , 21 The benefit of imatinib seems to be limited in the presence of only KIT amplifications, 20 , 21 or mutations of the loop domain of the receptor. Both alterations represent mechanisms of resistance to treatment and occur very rarely in melanoma. 5 Avapritinib (BLU-285) is a highly potent and selective oral kinase inhibitor, designed"

Notably, this γ -secretase-activating protein does not affect the interaction of γ -secretase with Notch. Thus this raises the possibility that one may develop a Notch-sparing γ -secretase inhibitor by inhibiting this activating protein. The same paper demonstrated that the drug imatinib was capable of lowering β -amyloid levels specifically through inhibiting the interaction of this γ -secretase activating protein with its substrate. Thus this research presents one possible way to develop a Notch-sparing γ -secretase inhibitor. It is important to keep in mind, however, that despite the focus of the drug-discovery"

The Z9001 Trial revolutionized the treatment of GIST, demonstrating improvement in 1-year recurrence-free survival of 98% versus 83% in treatment and placebo groups, respectively [ 9 ]. Thereafter, the Scandinavian Sarcoma Group (SSG) trial, comparing 1 and 3 years of imatinib therapy, showed improved 5-year recurrence-free survival of 47.9% and 65.6%, respectively [ 16 ]. Of note, approximately 15% of GISTs have no detectable c-Kit or PDGFRA mutation [ 27 ]. The benefit from adjuvant imatinib is minimal in c-Kit/PDGFRA -WT patients. Specifically, in the study by Corless et al., imatinib was associated with higher recurrence-free survival versus placebo in patients with c-Kit exon 11 deletions but was not significantly associated with PDGFRA mutation or wild-type tumors [ 28 ]. Thus, risk of recurrence is higher, and treatment with imatinib is debated [ 29 ]. Nevertheless, NCCN recommendations suggest continued use of adjuvant imatinib therapy for these patients. GIST recurrence in the IM era is largely considered incurable, and treatment strategies are aimed at delaying progression [ 6 , 16 ]. Despite response to TKI therapy, many patients with high-risk GIST eventually develop recurrent disease [ 6 ]. In the SSG study, 65.6% of those who completed 3 years of adjuvant imatinib were alive without recurrence 5 years after study entry. However, 34.4% of those treated experienced recurrence requiring further management [ 16 ]. Table 1 highlights current institutional studies demonstrating benefit of TKI therapy for recurrent GIST. Treatment options are to initially escalate TKI dose or switch to a second-line drug, typically sunitinib malate [ 6 , 13 ]. Imatinib can be increased from 400 mg to 800 mg daily, with an approximate 30% response rate in patients with KIT exon 9 mutations and acceptable toxicity profile [ 6 , 31 ]. While c-Kit exon 11 mutations tend to have a higher response to imatinib, primary resistance in the first 6 months of treatment can occur with c-Kit exon 9, exon 18, and PDGFRA mutations [ 35 – 37 ]. Secondary resistance after six months can be observed with acquisition of new KIT kinase mutations such as in c-Kit exon 17 or c-Kit kinase domain 1 [ 38 – 40 ]. Table 1 Institutional studies demonstrating benefit of TKI therapy for recurrent GIST.   Study design Number of patients Primary endpoint Main findings Demetri et al.

These data indicate that among the reported c-KIT mutations in human hematologic malignancies, 10 of 14 confer factor independent growth to Ba/F3 cells. There is variable sensitivity of these mutations to inhibition by imatinib mesylate or PKC412. Notably, however, the most common mutations D816V and D816Y are highly resistant to imatinib mesylate but sensitive to inhibition by PKC412.

Neoadjuvant treatment in gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including imatinib, has been shown to be effective in several studies, but the duration of this treatment is still a subject of debate. Case report We report a case of a large GIST of the stomach in a 51-year-old patient with atypical presentation that was initially unresectable. Neoadjuvant treatment with imatinib for 16 months resulted in a good response, allowing secondary surgical excision. Conclusion Imatinib in neoadjuvant therapy should be continued as long as there is a good response and tolerance to the medication to obtain tumour downsizing compatible with carcinologic excision.

Key Summary Points The duration of neoadjuvant treatment of GISTs with imatinib remains a subject of debate Some authors recommend not to exceed 12 months. But there is no scientific basis for this delay Through this clinical case, the authors report a good tolerance and a good tumour response after 16 months of neoadjuvant treatment with imatinib, allowing the excision of a large gastric stromal tumour, and discuss the criteria to determine the duration of the neoadjuvant treatment The authors suggest, in the context of neoadjuvant therapy, to continue treatment as long as there is good tumour response and tolerance allowing carcinologic excision Open in a separate"

Example 15. Combination Treatment Prevents Colony Outgrowth in GIST-T1, GIST-T1/D816E and GIST-T1/T670I) Imatinib Resistant Cells Studies were performed which demonstrate that combination treatment with Compound A and trametinib prevents colony outgrowth in GIST-T1 (57 bp exon 11 deletion) imatinib sensitive cells, GIST-T1/D816E imatinib resistant cells and GIST-T1/T670I imatinib resistant cells. Assays were conducted in 6 well plates with 100 cells seeded per well. Cells were treated with vehicle control, Compound A, trametinib, imatinib (IM), or combinations thereof at varying concentrations, and the cells were cultured for 2 weeks. Post-treatment, the drug was washed out, and the cells were cultured in normal media for 1-3 weeks. The outgrown cell colonies were stained with crystal violet and counted. FIG. 8A shows images of representative culture plates and a graphical representation of the number of GIST-T1 colonies counted from various treatments. GIST T1 cells are sensitive to imatinib and Compound A as single agents. It is noted that each of imatinib and Compound A as single agents demonstrate approximately a similar reduction of GIST T1 colony outgrowth to 23-30% of vehicle control. Combination treatment for 2 weeks with 50 nM Compound A and either 50 nM or 100 nM trametinib unexpectedly led to complete cell stasis or eradication of GIST T1 colony outgrowth to the limit of detection as visualized with 5× objective microscopy, with no detectable colonies after removal of combination therapy for 9 days (note arrows in FIG. 8A ). In contrast, combination treatment for 2 weeks with 100 nM imatinib and either 50 nM or 100 nM trametinib did not lead to complete tumor cell stasis or eradication after removal of combination therapy for 9 days. FIG. 8B shows images of representative culture plates and graphical representation of the number of GIST-T1/D816E colonies counted from various treatments. It is noted that each of imatinib (500 nM) and Compound A (100 nM or 250 nM) as single agents demonstrate approximately a similar lack of cytocidal efficacy of GIST T1/D816E with colony outgrowth of approximately 61-72% of vehicle control ( FIG. 8B ).

The probability of progression free survival is tightly correlated with the level of response, approaching 100% in those patients who achieve a reduction of BCR-ABL mRNA by at least 3-log at 12 months. High Sokal risk predicts poorer outcome, but on-treatment response parameters generally override pretherapeutic prognostic variables. Standard"

It is not clear if stem cell transplantation/hydroxycarbamide is an appropriate comparator.

Abstract: Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized at the molecular level by the expression of Bcr-abl, a 210-kDa fusion protein with deregulated tyrosine kinase activity. Encouraged by the clinical validation of Bcr-abl as the target for the treatment of CML by imatinib, we sought to identify pharmacological agents that could target this kinase by a distinct mechanism. We report the discovery of a new class of Bcr-abl inhibitors using an unbiased differential cytotoxicity screen of a combinatorial kinase-directed heterocycle library. Compounds in this class (exemplified by GNF-2) show exclusive antiproliferative activity toward Bcr-abl-transformed cells, with potencies similar to imatinib, while showing no inhibition of the kinase activity of full-length or catalytic domain of c-abl. We propose that this new class of compounds inhibits Bcr-abl kinase activity through an allosteric non-ATP competitive mechanism. 16415863 1 2851522 9606 Organism:Homo sapiens http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb/ http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb/index.php/assay/inspect/660223 1 Inhibition activity comment Inhibition activity comment 4 2"

We then asked whether the pattern of regulation seen in BV173 cells would be reproducible in other Ph-positive cell lines and, conversely, be absent in Ph-negative lines. Generally, the regulation pattern could not be reproduced in Ph-positive myeloid cell lines (Fig. 6) ⇓ . The expression of the genes in question was either below the threshold of sensitivity of total RNA Northern blots or unaffected by STI571 (data not shown). In contrast, in many cases, the pattern observed in BV173 cells was reproducible in other Ph-positive lymphoblastic cell lines (Table 1) ⇓ , with the notable exception of SD1. This cell line is unique because it is EBV-transformed (30) . In particular, cyclin D2 was consistently down-regulated and the unknown gene DD221 was consistently up-regulated in all Ph-positive lymphoblastic cell lines treated with STI571. Similarly, there was a consistent pattern of up-regulation for BCL-6, although the extent was variable, and the gene is not expressed in all of the cell lines. Integrin α 6 was down-regulated in all EBV-negative B-cell lines, whereas its expression seemed to increase in CML-T1 cells on treatment with STI571. The level of expression was below the threshold of detection in TOM1 cells. Up-regulation of MPP1 and DDI was observed in the two B-cell lines (BV173 and NALM1) that originated from CML in blast crisis rather than from ALL. In some cases (OSMRβ, CSCP, and DDQ), the expression of the mRNA in question appeared to be restricted to BV173 cells at the given level of sensitivity.

However, resistance to imatinib has become a clinically significant issue, limiting its long-term efficacy. Numerous mechanisms have been associated with imatinib resistance, including mutations to the BCR-ABL gene, increased production of BCR-ABL, and activation of BCR-ABL-independent pathways (e.g., SRC-family kinases [SFKs]). Resistance to imatinib has driven the development of second-line therapies, such as dasatinib, a dual BCR-ABL/SFK inhibitor more potent than imatinib at targeting BCR-ABL. Dasatinib is approved for the treatment of patients with imatinib-resistant and -intolerant CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nilotinib, an analog of imatinib, more potent than its parent compound, is another approved agent for patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML in the chronic or accelerated phase. Nurses must be aware of what constitutes a requirement for treatment change and the mechanisms of resistance that inform the choice of second-line agents. Oncology nurses also must ensure that patients have been educated appropriately to understand imatinib resistance and second-line treatment options. This article explores the mechanisms and identification of resistance and treatment options for when resistance occurs, as well as nursing implications. \n                               \n              "

It is the agent for which more extensive data exists including the paediatric population, particularly when used as first line therapy. Used in this way, prognostic factors are well understood and allows the generation of time points, milestones, to evaluate the response to treatment. If CCyR is achieved, the pre‐treatment risk score of prognostic classifications does not affect the progression‐free survival (PFS). In addition, prior treatment with imatinib does not affect negatively the outcome of allogeneic BMT (Lee et al , 2008 ). Summary of results with imatinib: with a follow‐up of 7 years, the International Randomized Study of Interferon and STI571 (IRIS) study showed that 5% patients had discontinued imatinib due to adverse events, 15% due to lack of efficacy and 20% for other reasons.

Hematological resistance to TK inhibition has been reported to be more common with clonal evolution (58%) rather than the presence of BCR-ABL1 mutations (45%; ref. 54 ). The incidence of clonal evolution is further emphasized in blast phase disease (73%) in comparison to the frequency of kinase domain mutations (30%). Conversely, BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations are more prevalent during imatinib failure in those patients that exhibit clonal evolution (58%) than those with Ph+ metaphases as the sole anomaly (28%; ref. 55 ). SRC Overexpression SRC-family kinases play a pivotal role in signaling through surface receptors on hematopoietic cells, and of the nine members of the SRC family, HCK, FGR, and LYN are primarily expressed on myeloid cells ( 56 ) and can also be activated by BCR-ABL1 kinase ( 57 ). Imatinib resistance and progression to, in particular, lymphoid blast phase has been suggested to be mediated through LYN and HCK up-regulation ( 58 59 ). Imatinib-resistant cell lines have shown greatly increased expression of LYN, which were susceptible to apoptosis following treatment with a SRC inhibitor ( 60 ). SRC-family kinases are also implicated in imatinib resistance by virtue of stabilizing the active conformation of BCR-ABL1 to which imatinib is unable to bind ( 61 ). Similarly, an increase of LYN expression has accompanied failure of nilotinib treatment in CML patients ( 34 ). Targeting both BCR-ABL1 and LYN kinases may be required in resistant CML, and dasatinib has also been shown to be effective in imatinib resistance consequent to BCR-ABL1-independent LYN activation ( 62 ). Quiescent Stem Cells Despite the remarkable results obtained with imatinib, disease persistence is detected in the majority of patients. The failure of imatinib to eradicate all malignant cells may be as a consequence of the inherent insensitivity of quiescent CML cells to imatinib. These primitive leukemic CD34+CD38− cells, which have entered the G0-phase of the cell cycle and are therefore quiescent, account for less than 1% of total CD34+ cells present at diagnosis ( 63 ), and it is this quiescent fraction that is postulated to sustain the disease with the constant potential"

To assure that rapamycin indeed inhibited mTOR activity, the phosphorylation of p70S6K (a substrate phosphorylated by mTOR) was analysed. As expected, rapamycin strongly inhibited phosphorylation of p70S6K ( ). To address the question whether WT1 expression was dependent also on JAK–STAT signalling, STAT5 phosphorylation was evaluated after addition of the inhibitors. As shown in , inhibition of BCR/ABL1 with imatinib completely blocked STAT5 phosphorylation, as expected. However, STAT5 phosphorylation was not at all affected by the Akt inhibitor and was rather increased by the PI3K inhibitor, conditions that strongly reduced WT1 mRNA levels ( ). These results indicate that BCR/ABL1-induced upregulation of WT1 mRNA and protein is mediated via the PI3K–Akt and not the JAK–STAT pathway.

Gain-of-function mutations in KIT or PDGFRα are key drivers in most gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs). This trial was designed to test the efficacy and safety of nilotinib vs imatinib as first-line therapy for patients with advanced GISTs. Methods This randomised, open-label, multicentre phase 3 trial included 647 adult patients with previously untreated, histologically confirmed, metastatic and/or unresectable GISTs. Patients were stratified by prior adjuvant therapy and randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral imatinib 400 mg once daily or oral nilotinib 400 mg twice daily. Centrally reviewed progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. Response rates, toxicity, and overall survival were also analysed for the overall population and for mutation-defined subsets. Efficacy endpoints used the intention to treat principle. Here, the final results are reported. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00785785\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00785785\"}} NCT00785785 . Findings Because the futility boundary was crossed at a preplanned interim analysis, trial accrual terminated in April 2011. At final analysis of the core study (data cutoff, October 2012), PFS was higher with imatinib overall (hazard ratio [HR] 1.47) and in the KIT exon 9 subgroup (HR 32.46) but roughly similar between arms in the KIT exon 11 subgroup (HR 1.12). Sensitivity analyses suggested that informative censoring may have contributed, because of the high proportion of premature nilotinib progressions declared by local investigators and the design changes implemented following the interim analysis, potentially biasing PFS data in favour of the nilotinib arm. The most common adverse events were nausea, diarrhoea, and peripheral oedema in the imatinib arm and rash, nausea, and abdominal pain in the nilotinib arm. The most common serious adverse event in both arms was abdominal pain (imatinib, n=11 [3.5%]); nilotinib, n= 14 [4.4%]). Interpretation Our results suggest that nilotinib is not an optimal treatment approach for first-line GIST; however, future studies may identify patient subsets form whom first-line nilotinib could be of clinical benefit.

We report the final analysis of the core study as well as a subgroup analysis of efficacy outcomes based on KIT mutation subsets. Methods Patients Patients were aged ≥18 years, had a histologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic GIST, and had received no prior systemic therapy for GIST or had experienced a recurrence of GIST ≥6 months after stopping adjuvant treatment with imatinib. In addition, patients had at least one measurable site of disease on computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors based on investigator assessment, a World Health Organization performance score of 0 to 2 (capable of self-care, but not any work), and normal organ, electrolyte,"

Early Molecular Response—Seminal Studies As the use of real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) techniques for monitoring BCR-ABL1 transcript level began to supersede traditional cytogenetic monitoring and became more a commonplace in regular clinical practice, it was increasingly used to further demonstrate the importance of an early response to TKI therapy. The impact of molecular response at 6 and 12 months in patients treated with first-line imatinib was first reported by Hughes et al. in the cohort of patients treated within IRIS (International Randomized Study of Interferon and STI571) [ 17 ]. Among 476 patients with PCR assessment, patients with BCR-ABL1 transcripts \u003e10% at 6 months and \u003e1% at 12 months had inferior event-free survival (EFS) (7-year probability of EFS at 56.3% for patients with BCR-ABL1 transcripts \u003e10% at 6 months) and higher rates of progression to advanced phases. The first publication on the impact of early molecular response (EMR, defined as 3-month BCR-ABL1 transcript \u003c10% after conversion to the international scale) were reported by Marin et al. who analyzed data from 282 consecutive newly diagnosed CP-CML patients treated with front-line imatinib. BCR-ABL1 transcript level at 3, 6, and 12 months strongly predicted overall survival, progression free survival, and event free survival, as well as correlating with the likelihood of achieving CCyR, major molecular response (MMR), and complete molecular response (CMR) [ 18 ••].

Most GISTs harbor c-kit gene mutation (most frequently in exon 9 and 11) or platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) gene that results in activation of a c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase, and subsequent cell proliferation induction and apoptosis inhibition ( Yamamoto et al., 2004 ; West et al., 2004 ). Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown dramatic and sustained clinical benefit in GIST. Imatinib works by blocking the ATP-binding pocket required for phosphorylation and activation of the KIT and/or PDGFRA signaling pathways. GISTs can be subserosal and extend into the abdominopelvic cavity or alternatively can arise from organs outside the luminal gastrointestinal tract and is termed extragastrointestinal stromal tumor (EGIST).

The BNP mRNA levels were about 58% higher in the ventricles from imatinib-treated animals (Figure (Figure10B), 10 B), while no significant difference was detected in the WBZ_4-treated animals when compared with untreated mice. Finally, the reduced cardiotoxicity of WBZ_4 was directly tested in mice by determination of the percentage ejection fraction (EF) in the left ventricle by MRI of treated mice subjected to imatinib or WBZ_4 therapy (Figure (Figure10C). 10 C). Following 6 weeks of therapy, the cardiac EF was significantly lower in the imatinib group compared with controls ( P = 0.02), which is consistent with previous findings ( 15 ). Remarkably, WBZ_4 treatment had no effect on cardiac EF despite prolonged therapy (Figure (Figure10C). 10 C). Discussion We have modulated inhibitory impact by rationally reengineering imatinib motivated by the need to selectively inhibit the C-Kit kinase and curb imatinib cardiotoxicity. Since originally reported ( 15 ), this crucial side effect of imatinib has been a subject of some controversy ( 26 ). Our own in vivo and animal model assays corroborate the original findings and inspired our reengineering strategy.

The deregulated tyrosine kinase activity of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein, is critical for malignant transformation by activating several signaling cascades, including the PI3K/AKT, JAK2/STAT5, and MAPK/ERK pathways [ 3 ] . Imatinib mesylate (IM), a selective Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor by blocking the ATP-binding site of the kinase domain, has achieved a remarkable success in treating CML. Although IM treatment shows great efficacy in patients with newly diagnosed CML at the chronic phase, and to a less extent, at the accelerated and blastic-phase, imatinib-treated CML patients nearly all acquire IM-resistance and clinical relapse develops over time [ 4 ] . Point mutations in Bcr-Abl kinase domains, which prevent the binding of IM with Bcr-Abl, are believed to be the main cause of imatinib resistance. Among the known mutations, the gatekeeper T315I point mutation is the most stubborn mutation and poses a major challenge in the treatment of CML [ 5 ] . To overcome the acquired IM-resistance, new tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as nilotinib (AMN107), dasatinib (BMS-354825), and bafetinib (INNO-406), were developed"

This agent was the only choice for CML patients treatment, until the new therapeutic approach arrived such as tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Imatinib (Frazer et al., 2007).

Present study evaluated the miR-21 expression in CML patients and impact of imatinib therapy on miR-21 expression. It was observed that 9.22 mean fold increased expression was observed in CML patients before treatment of imatinib. Before treatment of the patients, CML phases had significant differences in miR-21 expression among chronic phase, accelerated and blast crisis had more than 3 and 5 fold increased expression in miR-21 expression compared to chronic phase. miR-21 has been found to be increased in hematological malignancies (Volinia et al., 2006)"

White blood cells (WBC) count increasing indicated a first relapse under interferon alpha.. A new investigational therapy with farnesyl transferase inhibitor (i.e. FTI from Schering Plough Laboratory) induced a transient peripheral blood response. The new oral agent STI571 was used, as fourth line therapy, at an 800 mg daily dose. A partial hematologic response was obtained with peripheral blood normalization. However a third relapse occurs quickly with STI571. Finally, a treatment based on homoharringtonine alone was initiated. At the time of initiation of homoharringtonine treatment, WBC count was 31,000/µL: 2.5 mg/m 2 /day, 14 days. At day 17, the WBC decreased to 2,400/µL.

                    "the compounds of the invention can be administered to patients whose cancer has become resistant to a tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( e.g ., gefitinib or erlotinib). In this embodiment, the compounds of the invention can be administered either alone or in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In another embodiment, the compounds of the invention are useful for treating patients with hematological cancers that have become resistant to Imatinib, a chemotherapeutic agent that acts by inhibiting tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-Abl. In patients with CML in the chronic phase, as well as in a blast crisis, treatment with Imatinib typically will induce remission. However, in many cases, particularly in those patients who were in a blast crisis before remission, the remission is not durable because the Bcr-Abl fusion protein develops mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain that cause it to be resistence to Imatinib. (See Nimmanapalli, et al., Cancer Research (2001), 61:1799-1804 ; and Gorre, et al., Blood (2002), 100:3041-3044 , the entire teachings of each of these references are incorporated herein by reference). Compounds of the invention act by inhibiting the activity of Hsp90 which disrupt Bcr-Abl/Hsp90 complexes. When Bcr-Abl is not complex to Hsp90 it is rapidly degraded. Therefore, compounds of the invention are effective in treating Imatinib resistant leukemias since they act through a different mechanism than Imatinib. Compounds of the invention can be administered alone or with Imatinib in patients who have a Bcr-Abl associated cancer that is not resistant to Imatinib or to patients whose cancer has become resistant to Imatinib. Anticancer agents that can be co-administered with the compounds of the invention include Taxol ™ , also referred to as \"paclitaxel\", is a well-known anti-cancer drug which acts by enhancing and stabilizing microtubule formation, and analogs of Taxol ™ , such as Taxotere ™ .

Correspondingly, HGFL-induced Ron activation resulted in Y211 phosphorylation of PCNA while silencing of c-Abl blocked this effect. We show that c-Abl and Y211 phosphorylation of PCNA is an important axis downstream of Ron, which is required for cell proliferation. Treatment with a specific peptide that inhibits Y211 phosphorylation of PCNA or with the c-Abl pharmacological inhibitor imatinib suppressed HGFL-induced cell proliferation. Our findings identify the pathway of Ron-c-Abl-PCNA as a mechanism of oncogene-induced cell proliferation, with potentially important implications for development of combination therapy of breast cancer. \n Download PDF Introduction Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is an indispensable protein for cell proliferation.

Future antineoplastic therapies will be designed to target these molecular defects that characterize cancer cells and sustain their cancerous phenotype. Some drugs of this kind already exist such as Imatinib mesylate that was designed to target the bcr-abl oncogenic tyrosine kinase at the origin of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Moreover, as cancerous cells can develop resistance mechanisms to escape treatments, in particular to targeted therapies, it will be necessary to combine several drugs to affect the deregulated oncogenic pathways. It has been"

Gain‐of‐function mutations in KIT promote KIT autophosphorylation in the absence of stimulation by stem cell factor, ( 4 - 6 ) which causes activation of its downstream pathways (e.g. Janus kinase/signal transducer and activators of transcription [Jak‐STAT], Ras‐Raf‐mitogen‐activated protein [MAP] kinases, and phosphatidylinositol‐3 [PI3] kinase ( 7 ) ) and leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance. ( 8 ) Imatinib has shown anti‐tyrosine kinase activity in the wild type and some KIT mutants. ( 5 , 9 ) However, the D816V mutation in KIT is believed to influence the conformation of the activation loop lying at the entrance to the KIT enzymatic pocket, to which imatinib binds. ( 7 , 10 , 11 ) Therefore, cells bearing D816V KIT are resistant to imatinib. Unfortunately, approximately 80% of SM patients harbor the activating oncogenic D816V mutation in KIT.

Recent studies from our laboratory reported that human prostate cancer cells growing adjacent to murine bone tissue express and secrete high levels of PDGF AA and BB and that the tumor cells and, more so, tumor-associated endothelial cells express phosphorylated PDGF-Rα and PDGF-Rβ (8) . The inhibition of PDGF-R phosphorylation by STI571 coupled with administration of Taxol significantly reduced experimental prostate cancer bone metastases (8) and spontaneous disease in man (9) The aforementioned studies emphasize the significant contribution of PDGF-R signaling to the blood vessels that support the progressive growth of neoplasms and suggest that selective targeting of this pathway may be a practical approach to halt the growth of some tumors. In this report, we examined the direct effects of activating and inhibiting phosphorylation of the PDGF-R on purified populations of murine bone endothelial cells that express PDGF-R. We demonstrate that STI571 effectively blocks PDGF-induced cell survival pathways and, moreover, significantly sensitizes bone-derived endothelial cells to Taxol.

Phase I trials in which a molecularly targeted agent is matched precisely with a population of patients whose tumors are driven predominantly by the target of interest, as in the cases of imatinib in chronic myelogenous leukemia and trastuzumab in HER2 -amplified breast cancer, are rare. The vast majority of phase I trials evaluate new agents for which target tumor types have not yet been identified, and, as in phase I trials of cytotoxic compounds, toxicity is the primary endpoint and biomarker endpoints"

Since neoplastic KS spindle cells harbor a latent HHV-8 infection eradication is not possible [ 34 – 36 ]. One could start antiviral therapy in cases of aggressive disseminated KS with high HHV-8 viremia, aiming to at least resolve cytopenias. Novel targeted therapies are currently under investigation.

Results Grade III or IV potentially cardiotoxic adverse events (mostly edema or effusions) occurred in 8.2% of patients, were manageable with medical therapy, and infrequently required dose reduction or discontinuation of IM. Arrhythmias, acute coronary syndromes, or heart failure were uncommon, occurring in less than 1% of treated patients. However, administration of imatinib in a mouse model system resulted in inhibition of activation of protein kinases that are known to be important in the cardiac stress response. Conclusion We conclude that imatinib is an uncommon cause of cardiotoxicity and that the cardiovascular adverse events that occur are manageable when recognized and treated. Nevertheless, our pre-clinical findings suggest that imatinib remains a potential cardiotoxin. Furthermore the cardiac consequences of long-term imatinib therapy remain unknown. We therefore recommend treatment of risk factors for cardiovascular disease in imatinib treated patients in accord with the American Heart Association guidelines for the prevention and treatment of heart failure. \n Introduction The use of IM as a therapy targeting an essential signaling pathway (Abl kinase) in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) represents a new paradigm in rational drug design, and"

In all cases described so far, the additional cytogenetic abnormalities did not confer a resistance to imatinib mesylate. Furthermore, the persistance of a clone with the t(2;11) alone in our patient or the emergence of new Ph − unrelated clones as reported in the literature 11 , 12 demonstrates the importance of classical cytogenetics for disease monitoring of patients treated with imatinib mesylate before and during therapy. The clinical significance of the new Ph - clones remains to be elucidated, but it seems possible that they represent a reservoir for disease development (not necessarily CML) in these patients.

As can be seen, MDS and AML patients with MPO levels lower than 9.2 ng/mL tended to live longer than patients with MPO values higher than 9.2 ng/mL. Example 5 Correlation Between Plasma MPO Levels of CML Patients and Responsiveness to Gleevec Treatment Plasma (EDTA) was collected from 104 CML patients undergoing Gleevec treatment and MPO levels were determined as described in example 1. The medical status of the patients was then followed for a median period of 21.3 months. The MPO levels were compared with the incidence of the patients responding or not responding to the Gleevec treatment. The CML patients that responded to Gleevec treatment had significantly (P=0.03) lower MPO levels than non-responders ( FIG. 3 ). When CML patients in the ACC/blast phase (a total of 33 patients) were considered independently of the chronic phase CML patients, there was also a significant (P=0.04) correlation between MPO levels and response to Gleevec treatment, with responders having significantly lower levels of MPO than non-responders ( FIG. 4 ).

We examined the antifibrotic effects of imatinib using a bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model in mice because imatinib also inhibits tyrosine kinase of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs). Imatinib inhibited the growth of primary murine lung fibroblasts and the autophosphorylation of PDGFR-beta induced by PDGF. Administration of imatinib significantly prevented bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice, partly by reducing the number of mesenchymal cells incorporating bromodeoxyuridine. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage cells demonstrated that imatinib did not suppress early inflammation on Days 7 and 14 caused by bleomycin. These results suggest that imatinib has the potential to prevent pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting the proliferation of mesenchymal cells, and that imatinib might be useful for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis in humans. \n                               \n                                            "

Myocardial cells are unique in that catalase is located in the mitochondria as well as in peroxisomes, which may partially explain the finding that imatinib toxicity was confined to cardiac myocytes. Alternatively, it is possible that c-Abl has some as yet unknown direct function that prevents cell death induced through the ER stress response.

Caspase 3 silencing only partially increased cell metabolism in cells treated by Bcr-Abl inhibitors ( ), suggesting the existence of a substantial caspase-independent component in the effect of Bcr-Abl inhibitors on cell metabolism. By contrast, caspase 3 silencing did not affect imatinib and PD166326-induced GPA expression and hemoglobin accumulation ( and data not shown), confirming that Bcr-Abl inhibitor-mediated apoptosis and differentiation are independent processes.

                    "In some respects, the development of trastuzumab is an exemplar of preclinical-to-clinical translation, although interestingly, its use in other diseases where Her2/neu is overexpressed has only been proven clinically effective in gastric cancer, indicating the disease-specific context of such targets ( 80 ). In most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), the proto-oncogene c-kit has an activating mutation, and in preclinical studies in human GIST cell lines, the receptor TKI imatinib was shown to rapidly and completely eliminate GIST cells containing a c-kit mutation ( 99 ). These results were concordant with clinical activity in GIST, as early trials demonstrated promising efficacy in this chemotherapy–refractory disease and a phase III study confirmed a statistically significant survival benefit of imatinib in patients with unresectable CD117-positive GIST ( 81 , 100 ). Bedside-back-to-bench research used patient samples from a phase II clinical trial of imatinib to correlate mutations to clinical outcome and guide therapy, whereas preclinical studies conducted in GIST cell lines revealed that most mutations in the c-kit activation loop were resistant to clinically achievable doses of imatinib ( 101 ). Interestingly, it was in studies of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) that analysis of the crystal structure of dasatinib-bound abelson leukemia gene (ABL) kinase suggested that the increased binding affinity over imatinib was at least partially due to its ability to recognize multiple states of breakpoint-cluster gene, abelson leukemia gene ( BCR-ABL ), including BCR-ABL–activating loop mutants ( 102 ). Given this finding in CML, further preclinical studies of dasatinib in GIST cell lines were performed, revealing induction of apoptosis in the"

For example, with our greater understanding of the genetic defects that predispose to malignant cell growth has come the idea of therapeutic agents targeted to a single mutant protein. This approach can take the form of very specific kinase inhibitors (e.g., STI571 or Gleevec) or can attempt to actually manipulate the expression level of the target protein. This paper discusses the technology of antisense oligonucleotides as an example of the latter approach.

                    "CML cells through activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway ( Alvarez-Calderon et al., 2015 ). Consequently, imatinib-mediated BCR-ABL1 inhibition results in reduced glucose uptake through suppression of glycolysis, increased flux of glucose through the mitochondrial TCA cycle, inhibition of fatty acid synthesis, and restriction of de novo nucleotide production ( Gottschalk et al., 2004 , Barnes et al., 2005 , Kominsky et al., 2009 ). On the other hand, imatinib resistance in cell line models of CML has been associated with activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF1α), also resulting in increased glycolysis ( Zhao et al., 2010 , Kluza et al., 2011 ). One study used a large-scale loss-of-function RNA interference screen to identify genes whose inhibition synergizes with imatinib in the K562 CML cell line. Interestingly, this screen identified several different enzymes associated with glucose metabolism as synthetically lethal when used in combination with imatinib ( Gregory et al., 2010 ). The authors subsequently demonstrated that an enzyme involved in the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase (DLAT), is a critical mediator of CML cell survival upon TKI-mediated BCR-ABL1 inhibition. These data confirmed that inhibition of glucose utilization is partly responsible for the effects of imatinib treatment, but that mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation can provide protection against TKIs ( Alvarez-Calderon et al., 2015 ). Interestingly, they observed similar results in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (FLT3)-ITD-positive AML cells treated with FLT3 inhibitors, suggesting that this may be a general mechanism of TKI resistance, and not specific for"

He is also an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. But these new TKIs are not without their drawbacks, most notably adverse events. Dasatinib has been associated with pleural effusions, while nilotinib has been linked to biochemical changes in liver function and QT prolongation. And, as with imatinib, disease resistance to these newer agents could be a possibility. Additionally, the findings in both studies were reported after one year of treatment. \"Some observers may argue that one year is too early to claim victory in a disease with a long natural history,\" Dr. Sawyers pointed out. Despite the superiority of dasatinib and nilotinib in their respective trials, \"imatinib may survive the challenge on the basis of economic rather than scientific factors. . . with rising pressure to balance cost and efficacy, patients and payers may be forced to select the cheapest among three excellent treatment options,\" he wrote. \n                  "

Results Inhibition of Bcr-Abl with imatinib leads to a rapid and massive increase of PAR in human and murine Bcr-Abl-positive cell lines To investigate the effect of imatinib on PARP activation, different human and murine Bcr-Abl-expressing cell lines were incubated with imatinib for the indicated time points. In all cell lines, we observed a substantial and rapid increase of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins ( Figure 1 ). The kinetics of PAR formation differed between the cell lines starting after 6–8 h in the two slower growing cell lines M07BA and MEG-01 ( Figure 1a ),"

                    "importance of LynΔN kinase activity was confirmed by the fact that the protective effect of LynΔN on imatinib-induced apoptosis was suppressed by both SU6656 and PP2, two Src kinase inhibitors, and by the observation that expression of the kinase-dead form of LynΔN (LynΔNKD) failed to provide protection against imatinib-induced apoptosis. Thus, one could hypothesize that LynΔN inhibits one or several events involved in the induction of apoptosis by imatinib. As the effect of LynΔN occurs upstream of caspase activation and as LynΔN efficiently protects CML cells from mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, it is tempting to speculate that LynΔN may interfere with the function of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, therefore impairing their action on mitochondria. In agreement with this hypothesis, we have reported earlier that imatinib-induced apoptosis is integrated at the mitochondrial level and is accompanied by caspase-3 and -9 activation. 11 Inhibition of the p42/44 MAPK pathway by imatinib abolished Bim-EL phosphorylation on serine 69, impairing its degradation by the proteasome. 41 The subsequent stabilization of Bim is crucial for the induction of apoptosis in CML cells and also in other cell types. 41 , 42 , 43 In line with these findings, Kuroda et al. 43 recently showed"

More and more scientists believe that mixed drug therapy is the most effective treatment to AIDS by both inhibiting HIV reproduction and preventing the emergence of drug-resistant virus in vivo. In recent years, for other diseases, researchers have called the analogous pharmaceutical combination therapy a “cocktail therapy”. Because of the diversity of the patients and complexity of tumors, bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids and imatinib mesylates have shown their limitations while used alone (injection or oral), such as poor selectivity, low inhibition rate or low cure rate, high side effects or toxicity resulted from high doses, and the like. In order to solve the above problems, the present invention provides the combination of bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids and imatinib mesylates to improve the efficacy, selectivity and the cure rate in the treatment of tumors. At present, it has not yet been reported that the combination of bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids and imatinib mesylates is used for the treatment of tumor to improve the drug efficacy or cure rate. The objective of the present invention is to provide a “cocktail” or a composite medicine for treating tumors. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One object of the present invention is to provide an antitumor pharmaceutical combination charaterzied by a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid of Formula (I) and an imatinib mesylate (II) and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in Formula (I), R 1 is H or linear or branched alkyl comprising 1 to 10 carbon atoms; R 2 and R 3 each independently is H, substituted acyl, linear or branched alkyl, wherein the alkyl can be interrupted by O, N, S"

This study evaluates the radiologic characteristics of these neoplasms to discover specific signs leading to an earlier diagnosis. As part of a randomized phase III clinical trial of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), 72 patients with advanced stage GIST were treated with the selective tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor imatinib (Glivec, Novartis, Switzerland). For initial staging, 60 patients underwent MRI and 12 patients underwent CT. GISTs are mesenchymal tumors that grow submucosally and exophytically and become multiple, nodular or ovoid in the advanced stage. The predominant findings are peripheral solid structures with strong contrast enhancement and a central necrosis. Metastases are"

Muscle biopsy remains the cornerstone for the diagnosis. Parasitic infections, connective tissue disorders, hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies, drugs, and toxic substances are the main etiologic agents of eosinophilia-associated myopathy. However, in some cases, no known etiologic factor is identified, and these are considered idiopathic. Glucocorticoids are the mainstay therapy in idiopathic forms. Imatinib and mepolizumab, a humanized anti-interleukin 5 monoclonal antibody, may be useful in patients with eosinophilic myositis as part of a hypereosinophilic syndrome. \n                               \n                      "

This has been demonstrated in BCR/ABL-positive cell lines, cell lines engineered to express BCR/ABL, and in primary patient samples. Specimens from CML patients in blast crisis have increased levels of Bcl-X L and phosphorylated STAT5 compared with those in the chronic phase. Blocking BCR/ABL activity with imatinib in CML, megakaryocytic and pre-B cell lines results in growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis associated with decreased levels of pSTAT5 and Bcl-X L . The use of a BCR/ABL retroviral mouse transplantation model has helped to clarify the roles of the STAT5A and STAT5B in BCR/ABL-driven leukemogenesis. Deletion of"

In recent years, advances have been made in our understanding of the molecular biology and the pathogenesis of this disorder. Although three new agents have been introduced with some success for treating this disease, namely imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib, response durations are limited. For those patients who achieve a remission following the use of one of the aforementioned drugs, bone marrow transplantation is recommended. \n                               \n          "

Of the remaining six patients, five required therapy to be discontinued, but one patient managed to continue the same dose of imatinib therapy with adjunctive treatment (patient no. 10). Five evaluable patients improved within 48 h of stopping therapy (range 2–21 days). All managed to initially resume treatment with either the same ( n =4), or a reduced dose ( n =1) of imatinib mesylate; however, all patients developed recurrent cutaneous symptoms, the extent of which appeared to be dose related. Four patients restarted a 100 mg daily dose of imatinib mesylate, gradually incrementing to the target dose adjusted according to clinical symptoms. Owing to haematological necessity, the remaining patient (no. 9) was maintained on the same dose throughout with adjunctive prednisolone and cyclosporine. After a further 2 months, imatinib mesylate was withdrawn because of the desquamating nature of the rash and additional constitutional malaise, despite the initial achievement of both a haematological and clinical response. Imatinib mesylate therapy was not tolerated at the required dose, and the patient underwent disease progression. Five patients required therapeutic intervention with corticosteroids (oral prednisolone, range 20–40 mg daily, or a potent topical preparation (0.05% clobetasol, patient no. 10)).

Anti-proliferative effects of curcumin, imatinib and curcumin+imatinib combination on CML cell viability. Curcumin and imatinib were tested for their anti-proliferative effects on K562 (a) and LAMA84 cells (b). The assays were performed by using curcumin and imatinib singly (using the reported doses) or in combination (20 μM curcumin held constant and imatinib at reported concentrations. In K562 cells combination compound treatments showed significant differences compared to single imatinib treatments for all doses tested ( p  \u003c 0.001). In LAMA84 cells combination compound treatments showed significant differences compared to single imatinib treatments for lower doses tested (p \u003c 0.001 at 0.1 and 0.2 μM), while no significant differences were observed between combination compound and imatinib at 0.5–5 μM because high cell death occurred.

Stratifying GISTs into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk categories is preferred to classification into benign or malignant, as a small number of GISTs with a histologically benign appearance may recur or metastasize[ 12 ]. Such categorization helps select patients for adjuvant imatinib therapy[ 26 ]. Unlike other classification systems, the “modified NIH” classification includes “tumor rupture”, a prognostic indicator for predicting the benefit of further treatment with adjuvant imatinib therapy[ 27 ]. Tumor size and mitotic index are important prognostic features in risk stratification[ 13 ]. Assuming that all GISTs have malignant potential, Miettinen and colleagues demonstrated that the anatomic location of the tumor affects the risk of recurrence and progression[ 13 ].

Current management Surgery is critical to GIST management and remains the only potentially curative treatment for resectable GIST; however, oncologic surgery is still in its nascent stage and onco-surgeons are often inappropriately trained. The lack of harmony between the onco-/general surgeon and the medical oncologist is another challenge in defining the steps before and after diagnosis and staging. For those with locally advanced GISTs, preoperative imatinib mesylate for 6–9 mo to shrink the tumor, followed by complete cytoreductive surgery, is the optimal plan; early surgery by a general surgeon carries an increased risk of surgery-related morbidity and worse oncological outcomes. Most patients are managed by surgeons and gastroenterologists with limited expertise in oncology. There is a lack"

New cutoff points were calculated for ratios BCR-ABL/G6PD with \u003c0.13% for CCR, 0.13–1% for PR, and \u003e1% for MR and NR. Several parameters were investigated for predictability of cytogenetic and molecular response. BCR-ABL transcript type, prognostic risk groups, and pretherapeutic levels of BCR-ABL transcripts were not predictive for cytogenetic and molecular response on imatinib therapy within the treatment interval analyzed. In contrast, an association of clinical risk status and cytogenetic response has been observed in a study combining imatinib with pegylated IFN α 2b. 31 The earliest time point demonstrating a significant difference of transcript levels between patients reaching CCR and not after 1 year of therapy was 3 months. This result supplements data of chronic-phase CML patients intolerant or resistant to IFN. In this group of patients, CCR at 6 months was predicted by RQ-PCR after 2 months of imatinib treatment. 32 Within the observation time of median 24 months, three patients relapsed after CCR. Thus, there is limited information on the predictive value of residual disease levels for long-term response. However, all patients who consecutively relapsed had at that time CCR ratios BCR-ABL/ABL of \u003e0.1%. Ratios BCR-ABL/ABL \u003c0.1% were achieved in 39/69 patients (56.5%) on first-line and in 10/69 patients (27.8%) on second-line imatinib therapy. Longer follow up will certainly reduce the level of residual disease that can be used as a landmark associated with long-term remission. After a median treatment duration of 4 years with IFN, ratios BCR-ABL/ABL of \u003c0.045% have been associated with long-term event-free survival and low relapse rates. 12 , 29 More recently, we found in a longitudinal study on chronic-phase CML patients treated with imatinib after IFN failure, ratios BCR-ABL/ABL \u003c0.1% being associated with continuous CCR. 23 The question of how to express response data (absolute vs relative results) is still conflicting. It has been suggested for minimal residual disease monitoring in general that kinetics of response to therapy could be more important than absolute data at a single time point. 33 Therefore, as a relative measure, the proportion of patients achieving a reduction of residual disease by at least three orders of magnitude was determined. A \u003e3-log reduction of BCR-ABL transcript levels was achieved after 12 months in 27.6% of patients on imatinib therapy. The rate of \u003e3-log reduction was lower in this unselected group of patients than in PCR data from the total study, concentrating on CCR patients only (39%, Hughes et al , Blood 2002, 100 (Suppl. 1): 93a–94a, abstract). However, the overall rate of a \u003e3-log reduction after a median"

She underwent leukapheresis and was treated with interferon alpha (IFN) and oral cytarabine (YNK1). Nine months after diagnosis, she underwent autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). IFN was reintroduced 1 month after ASCT. Major cytogenetic response was achieved 16 months after ASCT. However, 4 months later, the patient lost the cytogenetic response and imatinib was initiated at a daily dose of 400 mg (February 2001). At this time, the patient did not have any biochemical abnormalities. Owing to grade 3 hematologic toxicity, imatinib was lowered to a dose of 250 mg, which permitted a stable platelet count. Complete cytogenetic response (CCR) was obtained 3 months after initiation of imatinib and remained for 12 months follow-up. In January 2002, the patient presented with an upper respiratory infection, which was treated with roxithromycin at a daily oral dose of 300 mg for 5 days.

It was found that treatment with the potent second generation BCR-ABL inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib also resulted in relapse and acquisition of T315I mutation in KCL-22 cells, but the combination with tenovin-6 or sirtinol effectively blocked the recurrence ( FIGS. 47B-C ) Four KCL-22 cell clones were generated, three of which can acquire different BCR-ABL mutations upon imatinib treatment, i.e. E255K (clone L1), Y253H (clone L7) and T315I (clone Ag11), whereas clone Ag3 develops resistance without BCR-ABL mutations. The combination of sirtinol with imatinib blocked relapse of all clonal KCL-22 cells on imatinib. In contrast, TSA failed to block relapse of these clonal cells ( FIG. 47D ). These results indicate that combination of SIRT1 inhibition with BCR-ABL inhibition is a powerful approach to overcome acquired resistance through BCR-ABL mutations. By gene knockdown, it was found that the ability for KCL-22 cells to"

Thus, circulating tumor (ct)DNA determination is expected to be an informative non-invasive dynamic biomarker in GIST patients. Methods We performed amplicon-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) across 60 clinically relevant genes in 37 plasma samples from 18 GIST patients collected prospectively. ctDNA alterations were compared with NGS of matched tumor tissue"

It is caused by a highly specific chromosomal rearrangement that produces an abnormal fusion gene called the bcr-abl (this is similar to the cause of APL, which results from a different chromosomal rearrangement). A dramatic advance was recently made in the treatment of CML with the approval of Gleevec, a new drug that specifically targets and inactivates the bcr-abl gene product. Gleevec can induce durable clinical remissions in a very high percentage of patients with early stage CML. Although it is active in patients with later stages of the disease, termed accelerated phase or blast crisis, the remissions are short-lived as resistance to Gleevec develops. There is a need to identify drugs that will enhance the efficacy of Gleevec in advanced stages of CML and in particular, prevent the emergence of resistance. Two publications indicate that TRISENOX may be the ideal agent to use with Gleevec for the following reasons:       It is active in CML by itself producing complete remissions in 74% of newly diagnosed CML patients in a study from China;       It causes degradation of the bcr-abl and therefore works in concert with Gleevec against the direct cause of the disease and prevents the emergence of resistance to Gleevec; and       CML cells are far more sensitive to TRISENOX than are normal blood cells.   7 Table of Contents  Trials exploring the use of TRISENOX in conjunction with Gleevec in both early and later stages of CML are in progress or are about to begin.  TRISENOX for Other Hematologic Malignancies.    A number of other cancers of blood and lymphatic organs are under study including lymphomas and leukemias.

We had previously shown that targeting the osteolineage compartment of the BM microenvironment can lead to successful reduction of LSC in CML. 15 Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting BCR-ABL1, the oncoprotein causing CML, does not eradicate LSC. 17 16 We hypothesized that treatment with GMI-1271 may lead to non-adhesion of CML-initiating cells to the BM endothelium and in combination with imatinib may be better at eliminating LSC in CML than imatinib alone. Indeed, in this study we show that inhibition of E-selectin leads to a dissociation of BCR-ABL1 cells from the endothelium. Concomitantly, this leads to increased leukemic cell proliferation and upregulation of the hematopoietic transcription factor and proto-oncogene Scl/Tal1, whose overexpression is frequently found in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 18"

First, we compared this method, termed Neutrophil-FISH, with interphase FISH (i-FISH) analysis of bone marrow (BM), i-FISH analysis of PB mononuclear cells, and conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA) of BM in 30 consecutive CML patients. We found the percentage of BCR-ABL-positive neutrophils as determined by Neutrophil-FISH to correlate best with the percentage of Philadelphia chromosome-positive metaphases in the BM determined by CCA (y = 0.8818x + 5.7249; r(2) = 0.968). We then performed a serial Neutrophil-FISH study of 10 chronic-phase CML patients treated with imatinib and found that the technique could clearly separate imatinib responders from nonresponders within 12 weeks of drug administration. There was a significant difference in the percentages of BCR-ABL-positive neutrophils between responder (mean 3 SD, 18.2% 3 11.8%) and nonresponder (82.4% 3 5.1%) groups at 12 weeks (P \u003c .0001, Student t test).Together with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, Neutrophil-FISH represents another useful method for monitoring CML patients during the primary myelosuppressive stage of imatinib therapy because it is a quick, simple, and reliable method for assessing cytogenetic response. \n                               \n                                      "

                    "activation was demonstrated to be a direct consequence of ERK signaling and a downstream target of Ras. Thus, it is not surprising that selective inhibition of these two proteins leads to SphK1 activity downregulation. Importantly, overexpression of SphK1 in LAMA84 cells could protect from manumycin A- and UO126-induced cell death, clearly suggesting the involvement of SphK1 as a downstream element of the Ras pathway. Before the advent of imatinib, Ara-C had a prominent role in the treatment of CML. Ara-C exerts antileukemic effect via mechanisms that are largely undetermined. Interestingly, resistance to imatinib in LAMA84 cells is not associated with resistance to near-therapeutic doses of Ara-C, implying that this drug could be efficient for imatinib-resistant patients. Remarkably, we found that Ara-C-induced LAMA84 cell death relied on SphK1 inhibition. Hence, both Ara-C- and imatinib-induced dissociated signaling cascades seem to converge at the SphK1 regulatory checkpoint. Of note, the rapid and transient increase in ceramide after treatment with imatinib, FTI, UO126, Ara-C or F-12509a was followed by a delayed, persistent and robust elevation. Such biphasic ceramide generation has been documented with other pro-apoptotic stimuli in various leukemic cells and is believed to play a role in amplification rather than initiation of apoptosis. As a matter of fact, the rapid ceramide increase triggered by imatinib occured before executioner caspase activation. It was not affected by executioner caspase inhibition in contrast to the late and sustained ceramide elevation, suggesting that this second ceramide generation occurred downstream of caspases (data not shown). Strategies to destroy cancer cells by increasing their ceramide content or blocking accumulation of pro-survival S1P should have a favorable therapeutic index. As previously shown in multidrug-resistant HL-60 AML, the F-12509a SphK1 inhibitor concomitantly blocked S1P biosynthesis and caused ceramide accumulation, efficiently accomplishing this goal in one single step. More remarkably in the clinical context, F-12509a was overall at least as effective as imatinib in killing CML primary cells, irrespective of them being imatinib sensitive or resistant. It is interesting to note that patient 8, the only one whose cells were less sensitive to F-12509a than to imatinib, had imatinib-resistant subclones with Abl kinase domain mutations F311L and T315I. The latter mutation is considered the most problematic for the clinical management of CML, as it produces a ‘strong’ degree of resistance to imatinib, which cannot be overcome by dose escalation, and which also confers resistance to other agents that bind within the ATP-binding site of the Abl-kinase domain of Bcr-Abl, such as nilotinib and dasatinib. The reasons why cells with a Bcr-Abl mutant ‘gatekeeper’ mutation such as T315I would also be refractory to"

To delineate the effects of imatinib treatment on Bcr-Abl wt and Bcr-Abl T315I/Y253H cell populations in vivo , we employed a murine retroviral infection/transplantation model of CML.

A longitudinal cohort study, which included 164 Yemeni patients, was performed. Data regarding the disease characteristics, adherence to treatment (the medication possession ratio) and outcome were analyzed. After a median follow-up of 60 months and a median duration of imatinib treatment of 46 months, 79 (48.2%) patients were adherent to treatment. In adherent patients, the overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) were 78 (98.7%) and 73 patients (92.4%), respectively and major molecular response (MMR) rates at 12 months and at 46 months were 32 (41.0%) and 45 patients (57.0%), respectively, compared with 67 (78.8%), 51 (60%), 5 (6.9%), and 2 patients (2.4%), respectively, in nonadherent patients (P \u003c .001 for all parameters). Nonadherence to imatinib treatment and duration of hydroxyurea treatment of more than 12 months before starting imatinib were found to adversely affect PFS in univariate (hazard ratio [HR], 7.5 and 9.7, respectively and P \u003c .001 for both) and multivariate (HR, 5.6 and 9.3; P = .001 and P \u003c .001, respectively) analysis. High risk Sokal score was found to adversely affect PFS in univariate analysis (HR of high to low risk, 2.8; P \u003c .022) but not in multivariate analysis. Yemeni patients who were adherent to imatinib therapy achieved response rates similar to that of international standards.

In particular, while tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy is effective in patients with PDGFRB rearrangement, there is little information on imatinib efficacy in patients with ETV6-ACSL6 gene fusion.

Introduction We report the second case of ETV6-ACSL6 associated myeloproliferative neoplasm that has failed a complete course of imatinib therapy and review the literature on this abnormality. ETV6-ACSL6 fusion is a rare abnormality that is associated with myeloproliferative disorders, myelodysplasia, or acute myeloid leukemia with eosinophilia or basophilia. The ETV6-ACSL6 results in a t(5;12)(q31~33;p13) that mimics the t(5;12) found in ETV6-PDGFRB neoplasms. Identification of the fusion genes involved in t(5;12) in eosinophilia-associated myeloproliferative disorders is crucial to direct an effective treatment plan. Evidence has shown sustained clinical response, molecular remission, and low toxicity profile with imatinib treatment in patients harboring PDGFRB rearrangement [ 1 ] but there is little information on imatinib efficacy in patients with ETV6-ACSL6 gene fusion. 2.

                    "to the fragile paediatric age group ( 28 ). Currently, the only alternative to avoiding a lifelong exposure to TKI treatment is the aggressive eradication of CML stem cells along with intensive regimens of chemotherapy and TKIs of limited duration. As of today, HSCT in paediatric CML is only indicated when CML takes a recurrent and progressive course ( 29 ), and this cures paediatric CML inconsistently, whereas imatinib only suppresses the disease ( 2 ). As the costs associated with HSCT are minor compared to life-long imatinib therapy, HSCT seems to be a preferred option for younger patients, however it should be considered as a last resort treatment for pre-pubertal children ( 2 ). A global protocol and registry for paediatric CML allows for an optimal approach, especially since knowledge on TKI absorption and its metabolism remains poorly understood due to the rarity of this malignancy. HSCT should be primarily reserved for patients in the accelerated phase or in a blast crisis of CML and those unresponsive to TKI therapy ( 28 ). Imatinib is an effective drug for the treatment of paediatric CML, limiting the progression of the condition to advanced stages, however, methods for improving the quality of life in paediatric patients that are on imatinib still need to be optimised. Further investigations are warranted for predicting the prognosis and the progression to advanced stages of paediatric CML. There is an urgent need for more multicentre studies to optimize the standardized management guidelines for treating CML with imatinib, while simultaneously maintaining a high quality of life in the fragile paediatric age group.

Some cases of HES are caused by the FIP1L1/PDGFRA fusion gene and respond to imatinib. FIP1L1/PDGFRA-positive HES occasionally evolves into chronic eosinophilic leukemia or into another form of myeloproliferative neoplasm; however, the development of a malignant lymphoma is very rare. We present a rare case of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and HES with the FIP1L1/PDGFRA gene rearrangement. A man in his 30s presented to our"

Perhaps the most dramatic example of how comprehending cellular signalling pathways can lead to the development of an effective, non-toxic therapy is through the Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib (formerly STI-571, Glivec/Gleevec). Pre-clinical studies in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) have demonstrated the selective inhibitory effects of imatinib against Bcr-Abl, with minimal impact on normal hematopoiesis. These promising results correlate well with the efficient inhibition also observed in both Bcr-Abl transgenic and transplanted mice. Though imatinib is a relatively novel therapy, its successful development has been (and continues to be) painstakingly thorough. Imatinib entered clinical phase I trials in 1998 and results were published in 2001. 1 , 2 Multinational phase II studies in CML and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) were soon initiated in 1999. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 Imatinib is currently being compared against the traditional interferon-alpha (IFN)-plus Ara-C in a randomized trial for newly diagnosed CML patients. Preliminary phase III data were reported at the Annual Meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in May 2002. 7 Now, more than 20 000 patients have taken imatinib with encouraging clinical benefits, including high levels of tolerance to treatment. Despite dramatic hematologic and cytogenetic responses, initial or acquired resistance to imatinib monotherapy has already become a clinical reality. Possible mechanisms of resistance to the drug were initially investigated in vitro and similar patterns were observed, at least in part, in patients. 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 A manuscript by Dorsey et al will appear later in this"

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the pharmaceutical formulations comprising imatinib in solid dosage form reconstituted with a diluent just before use. Pharmaceutical formulations of the invention in solid dosage form reconstituted with a diluent just before use comprise imatinib in an amount from 50 mg to 800 mg, preferably in an amount from 100 mg to 600 mg, more preferably in an amount of 400 mg as unit dose. Pharmaceutical formulations of the invention comprise imatinib in an amount up to 23% by weight based on the total weight of the pharmaceutical dosage form. Pharmaceutical formulations of the invention comprise imatinib in the mesylate salt form. Imatinib mesylate of the pharmaceutical formulations of the invention is in the α crystal form. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor; highly specific for BCR-ABL, the enzyme associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Imatinib is also shown to inhibit the KIT and PDGF receptors. Imatinib has the chemical name of 4-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)methyl]-N-[4-methyl-3-[[4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]phenyl] benzamide. Imatinib has the chemical structure of Formula 1. Imatinib is currently available in the market in capsule and film tablet dosage forms with the brand name Glivec in Turkey and Europe; and in film tablet dosage form with the brand name Gleevec in United States of America. Common imatinib doses are between 50 mg and 800 mg in orally administered tablet or capsule form for adult patients. Imatinib is used in the treatment of certain types of cancer, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Cancer is known to be a disease that reduces the quality of life of the patients due to the course of the disease, symptoms and complications; and also due to hard"

Although current therapies result in high complete remission rates, long-term disease-free survival rates have remained disappointingly low. Results from recent studies using risk-tailored approaches suggest improvement in overall survival for high-risk groups, such as those with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Furthermore, the incorporation of imatinib mesylate into the treatment regimen for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients may lead to better outcomes. Finally, quantification of minimal residual disease at various time points during therapy is being investigated as a means to predict more accurately a patient's response to therapy, and to make therapeutic decisions. \n  "

However, signaling pathways regulating both albumin-induced EMT and ER stress are not precisely known. We postulated that reactive oxygen species (ROS), c-Src kinase, and mammalian target of rapamysin (mTOR) would act as upstream signaling molecules. We further examined the effect of imatinib mesylate on these processes. All experiments were performed using HK-2 cells, a human proximal tubular cell line. Protein and mRNA expression were measured by Western blot analysis and real-time PCR, respectively. Exposure of tubular cells to albumin (5 mg/ml) for up to 5 days induced EMT in a time-dependent manner, as"

All patients gave written informed consent according to institutional guidelines prior to participation in this study. Patient disposition and treatment A total of 1106 patients were enrolled in the study between June 2000 and January 2001. Most (65%) patients randomized to IFN plus cytarabine crossed over to the imatinib arm, whereas 3% of patients on the imatinib arm crossed over to the IFN plus cytarabine arm. Since the last published update, no further patients have crossed over to the other treatment arm. Treatment intolerance was the most common reason cited for crossover to imatinib (26%), whereas four patients (\u003c1%) crossed over to the IFN plus cytarabine arm due to intolerance. In total, 364 of 553 (66%) patients randomized to imatinib were still receiving study treatment after 6 years of follow-up. Of the 359 patients discontinuing IFN/cytarabine and initiating treatment with imatinib on study, 239 (67%) remained on second-line imatinib at 6 years. Thus, 43% of IRIS patients originally randomized to IFN plus cytarabine were being treated with imatinib at 6 years. Since the last published report (data cutoff date January 2006), 18 (3%) patients randomized to imatinib discontinued study treatment (six patients discontinued due to lack of efficacy, one patient due to unconfirmed loss of CCyR and 11 patients for other reasons including withdrawal of consent or lost to follow-up). The median (mean±s.d., range) last dose given at the time of discontinuation of imatinib study treatment was 400 mg (467±179, 100–800 mg). The most common reasons for treatment discontinuation among all imatinib-treated patients were unsatisfactory therapeutic effect (12%), withdrawal of consent (6%) and AEs (4%) (but only 2% were considered related to study drug). Other reasons for study discontinuation included: stem cell transplantation (3%), protocol violation (3%), death (2%) and loss to follow-up (1%). Including the patients who crossed over to IFN plus cytarabine due to intolerance (1%) or lack of efficacy/progression (2%), a total of 5% of patients stopped imatinib study treatment due to side effects or AEs, and 14% stopped imatinib due to lack of efficacy or progression. Overall, 2% of patients discontinued imatinib therapy for reasons considered not related to imatinib therapy, including one case each of brain tumor, prostate cancer, small cell lung cancer, esophageal carcinoma, myelofibrosis, Steven–Johnson syndrome, thermal burn, fatigue and headache, car accident and influenza. Among patients who received imatinib as initial therapy for CML, median duration of treatment was 70 months (range 0.2–78 months). Dose modifications were uncommon; the average daily dose over the 6-year period was 402±56 mg for the 364 patients who remained on imatinib. The last reported daily dose of imatinib in this group was 400 mg in 83% of patients, and 300 mg in 7% of patients; a dose greater than 400 mg was reported for 10% of patients (600 mg (6%) and 800 mg (4%)). In total, 60 patients discontinued while in CCyR. The average time since last cytogenetic analysis in these patients was 6.9 months (median 3.4 months). For at least half of these patients, these discontinuations may be due to the fact that imatinib became commercially available in 2001. Of the 71 patients who lost CCyR on study, 24 (34%) remained on study and regained CCyR (in 7 of these 24 patients, CCyR was regained after imatinib dose escalation) and 6 (8%) remained on study in MCyR. Efficacy Response and duration of response Only 45 (8%) of the 534 (97%) patients who had achieved confirmed CHR, lost CHR during the study treatment. Another 24% of the patients who had achieved CHR had discontinued study treatment. Of the 490 (89%) patients who achieved an MCyR during treatment with imatinib, only 49 (10%) had documented loss of MCyR. Overall, 9% of these patients, as well as another 18% of the patients who had achieved an MCyR discontinued study treatment. There were 456 (82%) patients on first-line imatinib who had achieved CCyR at any time during the study (two additional patients since the last update). Of these patients, 385 (84%) did not have documented loss of CCyR. A total of 325 (71%) were still on imatinib study drug, whereas 60 (13%) patients discontinued study treatment without having lost CCyR due to safety ( n =22; 5%), unsatisfactory therapeutic effect ( n =8; 2%) or for other reasons ( n =30; 7%), including lost to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, HSCT or protocol violation.

The authors reviewed the known mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to imatinib and other TKIs used in the management of CML. Mutations within the kinase domain of BCR-ABLI account for 30% to 40% of cases of imatinib resistance. Other mechanisms include BCR-ABLI amplification, overexpression of the SRC family of kinases, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors. Although not all resistance mechanisms have been identified and understood, several agents based on the known mechanisms have already been designed and developed and are beginning clinical trials. \n      "

Consequently, these MCR (multicomponent reactions) are important in accessing highly functionalised building blocks commonly used in early research and discovery programs to enable scoping of structure activity patterns. A modification of the above pyrimidine synthesis has been applied in the generation of imatinib ( 3.36 , Gleevec) which is Novartis’ tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of chronic myeloic leukaemia. In a patented route the aldol product 3.47 undergoes a condensation reaction with guanidine 3.48 in basic media to give the 2-aminopyrimidine 3.49 ( Scheme 37 ) [ 93 ]. After generating the functional pyrimidine core a hydrazine-mediated reduction of the nitro group in the side chain was conducted with Raney-Nickel as the catalyst. Amide formation with 4-chloromethylbenzoyl chloride ( 3.50 ) and a direct displacement of the benzylic chloride with N -methylpiperazine ( 1.118 ) complete this synthesis of imatinib in excellent overall yields. Open in a separate window Scheme 37 Synthesis of imatinib. One noteworthy feature of this imatinib synthesis is that it is specifically designed for facile isolation of intermediates by precipitation due to their limited solubility in non-polar solvents [ 94 ]. Whilst this process was efficient in enabling the isolation of pure material after each step, it does not encourage telescoping of steps, which would in principal increase the overall efficiency of the process. Recently, similar approaches have been utilised in the academic environment using enabling techniques in a route to imatinib. For instance, our group has employed continuous flow synthesis methods to imatinib [ 95 – 96 ]. The route not only afforded imatinib but led to many previously inaccessible derivatives in an automated fashion within a single working day ( Scheme 38 ). In addition, this particular sequence showcases the uses of scavenger resins for in-line purification as the synthesis progresses and features the use of a Buchwald–Hartwig amination in a late stage fragment coupling. While it was sufficient to access only small amounts of these structures (around 50 mg), these techniques are currently being adopted by several major pharmaceutical companies in order to enhance drug development and even manufacturing sequences.

                    "Similar to nilotinib, dasatinib is another second generation TKI that was developed for the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML. Dasatinib resembles nilotinib in that it is a substrate of both ABCB1 and ABCG2 ( Giannoudis et al., 2008 ; Hiwase et al., 2008 ). In collaboration with Dr. Susan Bates and her colleagues at NCI, NIH, we demonstrated that ABCG2- and ABCB1-overexpressing K562 cells were resistant to treatment with imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, indicating that all three drugs are substrates for ABCG2 and ABCB1 and that ABC transporter function in cells could cause inherent resistance to these TKIs ( Dohse et al., 2010 ). It has also been shown very recently that penetration of dasatinib across the BBB is influenced by the presence of P-gp and ABCG2 and this uptake was significantly increased in the absence of P-gp and ABCG2 in Abcb 1 a/1b (−/−) and Abcg 2(−/−) mice ( Chen et al., 2009 ; Lagas et al., 2009 ). The question of whether dasatinib, imatinib or nilotinib at higher concentrations still function as substrates or as inhibitory molecules is crucial for predicting the involvement of these transporters in the development of resistance to TKIs. The plasma levels of 4 μM, 2 μM, and 100 nM have been reported for imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, respectively ( Bradeen et al., 2006 ), the concentrations needed to inhibit ABC transporter proteins (as shown in Table 1 ) may thus be clinically achievable for these TKIs in patients. 4.1.4 Gefitinib (Iressa, ZD1839) Gefitinib is the first selective inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptors’ (EGFRs)"

We were concerned that more prolonged therapy would be associated with increased toxicity, cost, and possibly resistance, but not with significantly more anti-melanoma effects. We are aware that more prolonged courses of adjuvant targeted therapy have been used in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) where 1 year of adjuvant imatinib was associated with improved RFS, but not OS, compared to placebo [ 12 ]. More recently, a 3-year course of adjuvant imatinib was found to be superior to 1 year of therapy for both RFS and OS [ 13 ] although the OS data require longer follow up as the curves did not separate until 3 years and there were relatively few deaths, almost half of which were not attributed to GIST. Therefore, the effect of prolonged adjuvant imatinib on GIST-specific OS remains uncertain. Our results showed that the 2 year RFS was 28.6% leading to our inability to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, our data do not support the hypothesis that 4 months of adjuvant dabrafenib will improve RFS. There are several possible reasons for these negative results."

Importantly, both fusion proteins were shown to have similar helix-loop-helix domains, which is fused to the kinase domain of ABL1 and implicated in protein oligomerisation process [ 31 ]. Indeed ETV6-ABL1 positive patients respond to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) as expected. Kawamata et al., reported a favourable response to imatinib in chronic phase CML with normal karyotype and ETV6-ABL1 [ 20 ]. However, the inhibitory effect of imatinib was short lived and unable to induce a complete remission in two further CML cases [ 13 , 15 ]. Similarly, Nand et al., [ 21 ] reported an ETV6-ABL1 fusion positive patient with a myeloproliferative disorder who developed morphologic and cytogenetic relapse after 17 months on imatinib but achieved complete remission on a second second-generation TKI (nilotinib). After an initial haematological response to imatinib 400 mg daily our patient, who presented with typical chronic phase CML and t(9;12)(q34;p13) as sole karyotype abnormality, progressed at 3 months; whereas nilotinib achieved a prompt CCyR, followed by an MMR 16 months after diagnosis, which is sustained to date. The mechanism of the imatinib resistance reported here and by others is still unexplained. Although the long-term response to second generation TKIs remains to be determined, their implementation as first line therapy in ETV6-ABL1 (+) disorders is well supported. Conclusion In summary, we highlight two main features of ETV6-ABL1 positive disorders: firstly, the diagnostic value of FISH with the ETV6 (BA) probe and secondly, while this chimeric oncogene is associated with poor long term response to imatinib, our patient achieved a sustained response to nilotinib.

This resistance is due to the development of new mutations in the Bcr−Abl1 fusion gene. Table 2 is a list of the mutations in Bcr−Abl1 that have been observed with continued TKI treatment [ 51 ]. A large number of mutations arose after use of the first−generation TKI imatinib that produces resistance to the agent. A common feature of those mutations is that they are near or in the imatinib binding site. There are a large number of mutations at the ATP binding pocket at the SH2 contact, C−lobe, the activation loop, and a few at gate keeper residues (where ATP accesses the kinase domain and mediates the conformation change from close to open). Among them, the most resistant is the T315I mutation that makes the Bcr−Abl1 kinase’s ATP binding pocket inaccessible to imatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and dasatinib. The T315I mutation is estimated to be as high as 19% in the general population [ 71 , 72 , 73 , 74 , 75 ]. Table 2 TKI−resistant mutations observed in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).

Omacetaxine is a BCR-ABL1 independent drug which has been shown to induce apoptosis in primary CML stem cells through downregulation of the anti-apoptotic Mcl1-1 protein (Allan et al., 2011). Cessation of imatinib treatment has been investigated in the Stop Imatinib (STIM) trial, which enrolled patients with complete molecular responses (CMR) of more than two years (Mahon et al., 2010). In a recent update, 61% of patients had experienced a molecular relapse, with 95% of events occurring within 7 months of stopping imatinib. Of note, almost all patients remained sensitive to imatinib and achieved CMR once imatinib was restarted. Similar observations were made in the TWISTER trial (Ross et al., 2013). However, while these studies demonstrate that stopping TKI therapy is feasible and some patients may be cured, TKI discontinuation still should only be performed under within the confines of clinical trials and requires rigorous patient monitoring"

Most of them can be detected by CT. These tumors have been found to harbor mutations in CD117 which causes constitutional activation of the tyrosine kinase signaling pathway and is considered to be pathognomic. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib have revolutionized the treatment of these tumors, which are otherwise resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment, tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been useful in prolonging the recurrence-free survival of these patients. Resistance to imatinib has been reported in GISTs with specific mutations. We present a case of gastric GIST which grew to a very large size and was associated with abdominal pain and weight loss.

Abstract: The majority of kinase inhibitors that have been developed so far--known as type I inhibitors--target the ATP binding site of the kinase in its active conformation, in which the activation loop is phosphorylated. Recently, crystal structures of inhibitors such as imatinib (STI571), BIRB796 and sorafenib (BAY43-9006)--known as type II inhibitors--have revealed a new binding mode that exploits an additional binding site immediately adjacent to the region occupied by ATP. This pocket is made accessible by an activation-loop rearrangement that is characteristic of kinases in an inactive conformation. Here, we present a structural"

The molecular consequence of this translocation is the generation of a BCR–ABL fusion oncogene, resulting in the production of a constitutively activated BCR–ABL tyrosine kinase. This kinase is capable of inducing leukemias in mice. Importantly, the tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR–ABL protein is essential to its transforming ability, making this an ideal therapeutic target. Imatinib mesylate (trade name Gleevec, formerly known as STI571), a specific Abl kinase inhibitor, blocks the ATP-binding site of the Abl kinase and has been shown to arrest growth and induce apoptosis in BCR–ABL -expressing hematopoietic cells. In phase II clinical trials, imatinib has shown activity in all phases of CML (chronic phase, accelerated phase, and blast crisis), inducing major cytogenetic responses (MCR; defined as 1–35% Ph+ bone marrow metaphases) in 41%, and complete cytogenetic responses (CCR; defined as 0% Ph+ bone marrow metaphases) in 19% of the late chronic phase patients. Preliminary results of a phase III randomized study in newly diagnosed CML patients show even more impressive results with CCR in up to 40% of patients within 6 months of therapy and superior progression-free survival compared to interferon. While imatinib was well tolerated to date in clinical trials and appears as a safe agent for chronic administration, little is known about its potential for long-term efficacy and toxicity because of the relatively short follow-up time since its introduction into clinical use. While clonal evolution within the context of the Ph+ clone is documented in patients treated with imatinib, the identification of clonal abnormalities in cells lacking the Ph chromosome during treatment is rare and has not been previously studied following imatinib. In this report, we present seven CML patients treated with imatinib at our institution in whom we identified clonal abnormalities in BCR–ABL -negative cells. All seven patients had achieved an MCR on imatinib when these clonal abnormalities were identified. This article documents the morphologic and cytogenetic findings in these patients. Some of these patients are from the initial cohort of phase I chronic-phase CML patients treated with imatinib, with follow-up intervals of up to 33 months. Patients Review of Leukemia Center records at Oregon Health \u0026 Science University (OHSU) identified seven CML patients (chronic and accelerated phases), who had achieved low-level Ph+ disease following treatment with imatinib (on Novartis studies 01, 109, 110, and 114) and who had evidence of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities in Ph− cells. The seven patients were from a total of 231 patients who received imatinib therapy for CML on study at our institution. Seven matched imatinib-treated CML patients with complete hematologic responses (CHR) and MCR, but without clonal abnormalities in Ph− cells were selected for comparison. All 14 patients were treated with interferon before being treated with imatinib. The Institutional Review Board at OHSU approved this retrospective study. In all patients, the diagnosis of CML was confirmed prior to imatinib treatment by morphologic review of peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow, and by documentation of the presence of the BCR–ABL translocation by conventional metaphase cytogenetic analysis or molecular studies. The patients were initially treated with imatinib at oral doses of 250–1000 mg per day (with subsequent escalations and reductions as per protocol), and were followed with complete blood counts (CBCs) and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy every 2–6 months. Bone marrow specimens were subjected to morphologic evaluation, routine metaphase karyotypic analysis, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)"

A large number of TKIs targeting different oncogenic signaling pathways have been developed, and are currently used in the clinic or being tested in clinical trials. Interestingly, it has been reported that several TKIs, such as gefitinib, imatinib, and lapatinib can interact with ABCG2, thereby inhibiting its drug transport activity and enhancing the anticancer efficacy of conventional chemotherapeutic agents ( 4 ).

Secondary resistance may have a wide range of causes, of which the best characterized is the acquisition of mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain (such as the T315I mutation) ( 6 ). In the last few years, two new tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), dasatinib and nilotinib, have become available, both of which are more potent in vitro inhibitors of the BCR-ABL1 kinase than imatinib. Both of these “second-generation” TKIs are effective at inducing or restoring CCyR in 40%–50% of patients who appear to have failed primary treatment with imatinib. However, approximately 20% of patients presenting with CML-CP fail to respond to both imatinib and a subsequent second-generation TKI; their prognosis is poor because of a higher risk of disease progression. Before the advent of BCR-ABL1 TKIs, all patients with CML-CP progressed spontaneously to advanced phase CML after a median interval of approximately 5 years.

Moreover, nilotinib’s low incidence of adverse events enhances drug compliance, making nilotinib more attractive than imatinib in the treatment of Ph + ALL [ 49 ]. The anti-CD122-conditioned NOD/SCID xenograft mouse assay with IBMI and the finding that LPCs were enriched in the CD34 + CD38 − CD58 − fraction in Ph + ALL patients provided us with a useful LPCs target and xenograft model for examining the anti-LPCs efficacy of drug treatment in Ph + ALL [ 10 ]. Indeed, the in vivo oral administration of ruxolitinib and nilotinib for 2 weeks significantly reduced infiltrated human leukemic cells to a greater extent in multiple hematopoietic tissues than did nilotinib or imatinib monotherapy. In contrast, ruxolitinib had no anti-LPCs effects when administered alone and was unable to augment the immediate effects of TKIs in rapidly decreasing the leukemia burden during the initial phase of therapy.

The rest of reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). 4.2. Cell Culture and Development of Imatinib Resistant Cell Line KU812 cell line was obtained through the American Type Culture Collection and was grown in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mM glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . For hypoxia, cells were kept in a hypoxia chamber (XVivo, Biospherix, Parish, NY, USA) containing 1% oxygen and 5% CO 2 for at least 5 days prior to performance of experiments. For KU812 imatinib treated cells, KU812 parental cells were treated with 0.08 µM of imatinib for 72 h prior to performance of experiments. To generate imatinib resistant cells, KU812 parental cells were treated with increasing concentrations of imatinib (0.074–1 µM), using an increase of 0.017 µM every week depending on cell health. Cells were considered resistant to imatinib when their doubling time in the presence of 1 µM imatinib was almost the same as that of the parental cells in the absence of imatinib. Acquisition of resistance was verified by determining the IC 50 concentration of imatinib after 72 h of treatment. Imatinib resistant cells were maintained with additional supplementation of 0.2 µM imatinib. 4.3. Cell Viability Assays IC 50 concentration was determined from dose-response curves where cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of a drug, and determining their cell viability using Cell Titer-Glo ® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) or Hoechst (HO33342) staining, both according to manufacturer’s instructions. 4.4.

We also established that pharmacologic inhibition of the mTORC1/mTORC2 complexes is sufficient to cause these antileukemic effects. Our results support the development of inhibitors of the mTORC1/2 complexes for the therapy of leukemias that either express BCR/ABL or display deregulation of the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway. \n Download PDF Introduction BCR/ABL is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that promotes leukemogenesis. Imatinib and other tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKI) induce complete remissions in the vast majority of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and exert significant antileukemic effects in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) expressing the BCR/ABL oncoprotein. However, even though TKI therapy achieves long-term control of CML in the majority of patients,"

The identification of a post-translational regulatory mechanism of imatinib binding affinity to Bcr-Abl may represent a further mechanism of resistance. The upregulation of kinases specifically phosphorylating Bcr-Abl at Tyr393 or the downregulation of phosphatases responsible for removing the phosphoryl group from this tyrosine could lead to an increased resistance of Bcr-Abl-expressing cells. Until now, the kinases and phosphatases responsible"

Accordingly, inhibition of PDGFR and its downstream pathway has become an area of increasing focus for drug development. Specific inhibitors of PDGFR, such as the small-molecule drug Gleevec® (STI-571; Imatinib mesylate), have recently been developed and are in clinical trials for treatment of certain cancers, including prostate and ovarian cancers. It has been shown that Gleevec® induces durable responses in patients with chronic myelo-proliferative diseases associated with activation of PDGFR (see Apperley et al., N. Engl. J.

Consistent with this model, siRNA-mediated knockdown or small molecule inhibition of AKT (AKT inhibitor IV) prevented eIF4E-mediated increases in beta-catenin transcriptional activity. The importance of eIF4E phosphorylation on beta-catenin activation and the self-renewal capacity of primary BC GMPs cells was assessed. Treatment with CGP57380, but not imatinib or dasatinib, inhibited eIF4E phosphorylation, as well as preventes accumulation of active nuclear beta-catenin in BC GMPs. The effect of MNK1/2 inhibition was evaluated on the stem cell function of BC cells using both in vitro and in vivo assays. In an in vitro serial replating assay, it was shown that CGP57380 impaired the ability of CD34+ BC cells (including those carrying T315I mutation), but not normal CD34+ cells, to serially replate for more than 8 weeks in methylcellulose. Interestingly, treatment with either imatinib or dasatinib only partially impaired the ability of BC-CML to serially replate. In vitro treatment of BC CD34+ CML cells, but not normal cord blood CD34+ cells, with CGP57380 retarded their ability to engraft NSG mice. Finally, in vivo serial transplantation assay for assessing the leukemia stem cell (LSC) function"

Abstract: Inhibitors of histone deacetylases are a new class of cancer therapeutics with possibly broad applicability. Combinations of HDAC inhibitors with the kinase inhibitor 1 (Imatinib) in recent studies showed additive and synergistic effects. Here we present a new concept by combining inhibition of protein kinases and HDACs, two independent pharmacological activities, in one synthetic small molecule. In general, the HDAC inhibition profile, the potencies, and the probable binding modes to HDAC1 and HDAC6 were similar as for 6 (SAHA). Inhibition of Abl kinase in biochemical assays was maintained for most compounds, but in general the kinase selectivity profile differed from that of 1 with nearly equipotent inhibition of the wild-type and the Imatinib resistant Abl T(315)I mutant. A potent cellular inhibition of PDGFR and cytotoxicity toward EOL-1 cells, a model for idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), are restored or enhanced for selected analogues (12b, 14b, and 18b). Cytotoxicity was evaluated by using a broad panel of tumor cell lines, with selected analogues displaying mean"

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have significantly improved clinical outcomes as part of multidisciplinary disease management. The authors will review developments in the management of GISTs, including diagnosis, risk stratification, prognosis, and treatment with imatinib. Imatinib is recommended for postsurgical adjuvant therapy and, where appropriate, neoadjuvant therapy. Clinical practice guidelines recommend first-line imatinib for metastatic and unresectable GISTs based on trials showing efficacy at the standard dose (400 mg per day) and at higher doses of 600-800 mg per day. Oncology nurses play a key role in patient management through (a) patient education about GISTs and their treatment including the use of imatinib, (b) timely scheduling of radiologic follow-up to assess treatment response, (c) monitoring treatment adherence, (d) helping to sustain imatinib dose intensity by monitoring toxicities and drug interactions and by counseling patients to prevent treatment interruptions, and (e) collaborating with the multidisciplinary medical team to pursue imatinib dose escalation or other treatment options if patients have primary or acquired mutation-based resistance to imatinib. \n                               \n                                                                  "

Nevertheless, the interaction between STI571 and other antileukaemic drugs such as hydroxyurea, interferon alpha or cytarabine have also been investigated in order to further improve its effectiveness. In this study we have tried to answer the question if the combination of STI571 with purine nucleoside analogues (PNAs)- cladribine (2-CdA) and fludarabine (F-ara-A) intensifies the antiproliferative effect on granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (CFU-GM) from patients with CML as well as from normal persons. Our studies were based on the method of semisolid CFU-GM cultures in vitro. We added STI571 or PNAs singly to the culture, each of the drugs at three concentrations, as well as in combinations of the concentrations used. We showed that STI571 (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 microM) used alone inhibited the colony growth of CML CFU-GM, as compared to CFU-GM derived from normal donors (p = 0.03; p = 0.0004; p = 0.0001). We also observed that STI571 used together with 2-CdA (5,10 and 20 microM) or F-ara-A (0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 microM) at all the combinations significantly inhibited the colony growth of CML CFU-GM, as compared either to the control or to STI571 used alone (p \u003c 0.05). In addition, the differences between CML and normal CFU-GM colony growth inhibition after the use of the combination of the highest concentrations of STI571 either with 2-CdA or F-ara-A were statistically significant (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively). In conclusion, STI571 used together with both the PNAs had an additive effect on CML CFU-GM cells. However, further experimental and clinical studies concerning the usefulness of these combinations in the treatment of CML patients seem warranted. \n                              "

TARGETED ANTI-CANCER AGENTS While only recently approved, the following targeted therapies have undergone extensive pre-clinical and clinical investigations, including pharmacokinetic analyses. This research has led to a reasonable understanding of their anti-cancer mechanisms of action as well as their pharmacology, both in terms of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. A brief presentation of each targeted therapy follows. Imatinib (Gleevec, Novartis) Imatinib is an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the use in treating chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, mild dysplastic diseases and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. [ 58 - 61 ] Imatinib inhibits the bcr-abl tyrosine kinase which is constitutively active in chronic myeloid leukemia in patients who contain the Philadelphia chromosome abnormality. The drug is also an inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinases for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), stem cell factor (SCF) and c-kit.[ 61 ] The major enzyme involved in the metabolism of imatinib is CYP3A4.[ 62 ] Other enzymes involved in the drug metabolism and which play a minor role include CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.[ 61 , 62 ] Its main active metabolite is formed by CYP3A4. Imatinib has also been found to be a potent inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5.[ 62 ] The FDA-approved Package Insert recommends dose reduction by 50% if patients are on an inhibitor of CYP3A4. It also recommends the consideration of dose adjustment if patients are on a drug known to induce the activity of CYP3A4. Finally, if patients are on drugs known to be metabolized by CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, caution is recommended given imatinib's inhibition of these crucial enzymes. In healthy subjects receiving imatinib and the CYP3A4 inhibiting drug ketoconazole, blood levels of imatinib (AUC) increased by 40%.[ 63 ] Further, serum AUC of the CYP3A4 substrate simvastatin was increased by 3.5 fold when given with imatinib.[ 64 ] Of note, in an 11-patient study by van Erp et al , researchers did not find a significant increase in imatinib pharmacokinetics in cancer patients treated with the drug after a three day administration of ritonavir.[ 65 ] The authors proposed this is due to alternative metabolic pathways which imatinib may undergo in the face of CYP3A4 inhibition. Whether this finding has relevance in patients on chronic HAART therapy including ritonavir is unknown. Dasatinib (Sprycel, Bristol Myers Squibb) Dasatinib is an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor which has been found to inhibit the bcr-abl, c-kit, PDGFR data and the SRC"

In a correlation of ACA with blast counts it was determined that ACA, in particular major route ACA, but also abnormalities of chromosomes 3,7,21 and 17 precede blast increase. The impact of minor route ACA could be eliminated by imatinib indicating that minor route ACA may not be relevant for blastic progression and may rather be bystanders than drivers [9].

Acquisition of drug resistance is not more evident elsewhere than in the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), Imatinib and Dasatinib, for patients with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML). Hence, while Imatinib initially produces remission in the chronic phase, ultimately these therapeutics fail via emergence of drug resistance, where CML can inevitably progress to a terminal blast phase culminating in a fatal outcome. Technically, it is challenging to predict the onset of drug resistance in a small number of oncogene-transformed cells, making"

However, these studies did not establish whether the effects of PDGF-A were specifically directed toward pdgfr α-LF or toward progenitors, which supplied the pdgfrα -LF population. Our novel findings indicate that protein tyrosine kinase signaling through PDGF-R and/or Abl maintains the pdgfr α myofibroblast subpopulation and that diminished PDGF-Rα signaling may promote septal thinning and maturation of the air-blood interface. This diminution is accelerated by imatinib. Using imatinib to disrupt protein tyrosine kinase signaling has distinct advantages and some disadvantages. Targeted gene deletions of PDGF-A or PDGF-Rα are gene and pathway specific, but they do not disrupt a particular phase of alveolar development, because the abnormalities begin in utero . Therefore, the observations made postnatally are compounded by abnormalities before P4, when septal eruption begins. Starting imatinib on or after P8 enabled septal eruption and early elongation to proceed normally, so we could specifically study subsequent septal elongation and thinning. A disadvantage is that although imatinib is selective, it likely inhibits PDGF-Rβ and Abl, as well as PDGF-Rα, under our experimental conditions. Nevertheless, inhibition of PDGF-Rα most likely accounts for our observations. Imatinib inhibited proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in the PDGF-Rα-GFP+ but not the GFP− sub-population, indicating that PDGF-Rα-kinase is necessary for the observed effects. Whether inhibition of PDGF-Rα is sufficient to account for our findings is less certain, because imatinib also inhibits Abl kinase. In fibroblasts, PDGF-receptors primarily activate Abl-kinase by signaling through Src and phospholipaseC-γ, rather than through phosphoinositol-3-kinase, the dominant PDGF-Rα-pathway ( 24 ). This suggests that PDGF-Rα may not initiate Abl-mediated signaling in LF. Although Abl is present in cultured mouse LF, its constitutive kinase activity is very low, and we could not demonstrate further reduction by imatinib (data not shown). Although others observed that inhibition of Abl by imatinib reduced TGFβ-mediated renal fibroblast proliferation ( 25 ), we have not observed this in mouse LF. We previously showed that proliferation decreased in pdgfr α-expressing LF at P12, whereas Smad-dependent signaling did not ( 13 ). Therefore, it is unlikely that imatinib interferes with activation of Abl-kinase by TGFβ, in our mouse LF cultures. Because PDGF-A enhances Akt-phosphorylation, pdgfr α-LF differentially maintains survival as long as signaling through PDGF-Rα is maintained. But as proliferation continues to decline, pdgfr α-LF diminishes so that septal thinning occurs ( Fig. 8 ). In conclusion, we"

                    "surface on the kinase domain activated both the SRC and ABL kinases. Other mutations have been found in the linker between the SH3 and SH2 domains, again activating the kinase. Finally, imatinib-resistant mutations have been mapped to the cap portion of the structure, the SH3-SH2 linker, and the SH3-kinase domain interface, all regions important to ABL kinase regulation. Together, it is postulated that ABL is autoinhibited and that imatinib resistance was mechanistically coupled to kinase activation. Hence, while imatinib trapped BCR-ABL in the inactive, autoinhibited conformation, mutations linked to imatinib resistance tended to activate the kinase, favoring adoption of the autophosphorylated state that resists imatinib binding. Thus BCR-ABL mutation can result in both steric and allosteric mechanisms of drug resistance. Imatinib-resistant mutations in c-KIT have also been found in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors, systemic mastocytosis and, in rare cases, with other hematological malignancies. These mutations have been localized in three different regions of the receptor: the juxtamembrane domain (prevalent in gastrointestinal stromal tumors), the activation loop of the catalytic domain (prevalent in systemic mastocytosis) and the extracellular domain. Interestingly, imatinib is effective at inhibiting KIT kinase activity only for mutations in the juxtamembrane domain-coding region. Mutations affecting the activation loop of KIT are resistant to imatinib. Flt3 is the most commonly mutated gene in acute myelogenous leukemia. In one third of these malignancies, internal tandem duplication of the juxtamembrane coding domain of this gene have been found, which correlates with adverse prognosis. Imatinib-resistant mutations have also been detected in the activation loop of FLT3, some of which appear homologous to those in c-KIT. The activity of Glivec in patients with newly diagnosed CML is being further investigated by a large randomized Phase III study to compare first-line therapy with Glivec against standard interferon in combination with low-dose cytarabine. This study, known as the ‘IRIS’ study (International Randomized study of Interferon versus STI571), has enrolled 1,106 patients. The results of an interim analysis with a median follow-up of 14 months indicate a better tolerability and a superior efficacy of first-line Glivec compared with interferon and low-dose cytarabine in terms of cytogenetic response, haematological response and, more importantly, time to progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis 46. Preclinical studies have shown that the combination of Glivec with various anticancer agents might have synergistic effects. Consequently, several Phase I/II studies are evaluating the feasibility of combining Glivec with interferon, polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated interferon, cytarabine and other single-agent or combination chemotherapy regimens, in patients with either chronic-phase or advanced CML. Tyrosine kinase-independent mechanisms include efflux and protein binding. Alpha-1 glycoprotein (AGP) binds imatinib with high affinity and blocks its biological activity (proliferation and kinase activity). Drugs known to compete with imatinib for binding to AGP, such as erythromycin displace (or prevent binding of) imatinib from AGP and restore imatinib biological and therapeutic activity. In addition to competing drugs for AGP binding, increased imatinib dosing may also overcome this mechanism. Similar to AGP binding, efflux mechanisms that expel imatinib from the cytoplasm (thereby, limiting intracellular tyrosine kinase exposure) may also be overcome with dose escalation. Unfortunately, increases in imatinib oral dosing is hampered by side effects. It is hypothesized that AGP binding and subsequent below-efficacy circulating levels of imatinib provide sufficient resistant mutant selective pressure to induce tyrosine kinase-dependent mutations. An additional tyrosine kinase-dependent resistance mechanism is gene amplification, whereby increased copies of the tyrosine kinase are produced. By example, it has been shown that increased chromosomal copies of BCR-ABL (e.g., \u003e14 copies) can grow in 1 μm imatinib. This cell line could be selected only by exposing cells to marginally active concentrations of imatinib (slightly less than its IC50). When active concentrations (1 μm) were used from the beginning, all cells were killed and no selection was possible. It is evident, therefore, that the exposure of leukemic cells to marginally active imatinib concentrations, which probably happens in tissues at present dosages, will favor such a selection. Important differences exist between this model and the clinical situation. Basal human AGPs levels are 4-5 times higher than murine ones; therefore, AGP levels can rise, after inflammatory stimuli, up to 20-30-fold over basal values in mice, and only 2-4-fold in humans. In addition, given the higher basal values in humans, “normal” levels of AGP are theoretically sufficient to bind most of the imatinib that is present in patients' plasma (17) In addition to various oncogenic forms of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, imatinib also inhibits the receptor for stem cell factor (SCF) c-KIT, a member of the type III group of receptor kinases. Preclinical studies have established that imatinib blocks c-KIT autophosphorylation, as well as SCF-stimulated downstream signalling events. In addition to treating gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), imatinib may also be successful at treating small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is one of the most aggressive and lethal cancers in humans. It constitutes approximately 15%-25% of all cases of primary lung cancers, Although standard combination cytotoxic chemotherapy agents have shown antitumor activity with initial responses seen in 70%,-90% for",

Chemotherapeutic agents have toxic effects upon multiple organ during therapy. By non-limiting example doxorubicin has a broad spectrum of therapeutic activity against various tumors. However, its clinical use is limited by its undesirable systemic toxicity, especially in the heart and kidney. Treatment with imatinib reduced the severity of doxorubicin-induced toxicity as assessed by reduced mortality, diminished volume of recovered fluid in the abdominal cavity, and severity of cardiac and renal lesions at both the biochemical and morphological levels.

Abstract: Recent data suggest that the role of CYP3A4 in imatinib metabolism is smaller than presumed. This study aimed to evaluate the quantitative importance of different cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes in imatinib pharmacokinetics. First, the metabolism of imatinib was investigated using recombinant P450 enzymes and human liver microsomes with P450 isoform-selective inhibitors. Thereafter, an in silico model for imatinib was constructed to perform pharmacokinetic simulations to assess the roles of P450 enzymes in imatinib elimination at clinically used imatinib doses. In vitro, CYP2C8 inhibitors and CYP3A4 inhibitors inhibited the depletion of 0.1 #M imatinib by 45 and 80%, respectively, and the formation of the main metabolite of imatinib, N-desmethylimatinib, by \u0026gt;50%. Likewise, recombinant CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 metabolized imatinib extensively, whereas other isoforms had minor effect on imatinib concentrations. In the beginning of imatinib treatment, the fractions of its hepatic clearance mediated by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 were predicted to approximate 40 and 60%, respectively. During long-term treatment with imatinib 400 mg once or twice daily, up to 65 or 75% of its hepatic elimination was predicted to occur via CYP2C8, and only about 35 or 25% by CYP3A4, due to dose- and time-dependent autoinactivation of CYP3A4 by imatinib. Thus, although CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 are the main enzymes in imatinib metabolism in vitro, in silico predictions indicate that imatinib inhibits its own CYP3A4-mediated metabolism, assigning a key role for CYP2C8. During multiple dosing, pharmacogenetic polymorphisms and drug interactions affecting CYP2C8 activity may cause marked interindividual variation in the exposure and response to imatinib. 23028140 1 117225 9606 Organism:Homo sapiens http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb/ http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb/index.php/assay/inspect/1489013 1 CL activity comment CL activity comment 4 2 CL standard flag CL standard flag 2 3 CL qualifier CL qualifier 4 4 CL published value CL published value 1 uL/min 5 CL standard value CL standard value 1 uL/min 6 CL"

Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the possible correlation of selected P450, ABC and SLC polymorphic variants and the outcome of imatinib therapy. A total of 101 patients with advanced, KIT/PDGFRA(+) GIST treated with imatinib were enrolled to the study. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples and genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP and direct sequencing. Deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was only observed for rs2740574. None of the studied SNPs was associated with GIST time to progression. No significant correlation between any specific variant"

The mechanism most classically apparent upon genome analysis is via mutations that interfere with inhibitor binding, typically inducing occlusion of the drug, loss of a favorable physiochemical interaction, or a change in an enzymatic property in the target. One of the first examples was revealed in the blood and bone marrow of CML patients treated with the ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib ( 136, 137 ). Importantly, BCR-ABL signaling was re-activated in patients that acquired a mutation resulting in a single amino acid substitution of a critical threonine residue in the ABL kinase domain (T315I) required for imatinib binding. Moreover, similar observations were made in experimental models of imatinib resistance, providing a convenient cell-based model for the evaluation of additional mutations ( 138 ) and establishing one of a suite of experimental cell and mass spectrometry–based approaches for the analysis of new allosteric BCR-ABL inhibitors developed to overcome drug-resistant CML ( 122, 139 ).

Six dealt mainly with interferon-based therapies, 7 with bone marrow transplantation and only 2 evaluated PROs in the context of TT. No disease-specific, validated PRO instrument for these patients was found. The main evidence being that Imatinib provides clear advantage in terms of HRQOL over interferon-based treatments. There is lack of data concerning PROs in patients treated with current TT.

We sought to examine the expression of PDGF ligand A and receptor alpha in pituitary tumors. Upon immunohistochemical analysis of pituitary tumor samples, expression of PDGF ligand A (34 of 48 cases) and PDGF receptor alpha (35 of 48 cases) was observed, which provides the rationale for use of Gleevec. The in vitro efficacy of the drug in a rat pituitary tumor cell line GH3 and pituitary primary human tumor cultures was demonstrated by MTT assays. The IC50 values ranged from 14.6 μM in primary pituitary cultures to 21 μM in the GH3 cell line. The mechanism of cytotoxicity was determined to be apoptosis by the TUNEL assay and cell cycle analysis. We plan on testing the efficacy of Gleevec in an in vivo animal model.

We uncovered here that upregulation of c-KIT by FUBP1 and RUNX1 impacts cell proliferation, which can be counteracted by the pharmacological c-KIT inhibitor, imatinib mesylate. Altogether, our data underscore a novel mechanism of regulation of the oncogene c-KIT that could play a role in pathophysiological context of RUNX1 and FUBP1 deregulation.

Binding of TM4SF complex to c-kit could result in basal phosphorylation of c-kit and paradoxically reduces kinase activity and downstream with proproliferating effect [ 7 ]. That observation has not been fully elucidated but it is very interesting in light of cases of chemoresistance to Imatinib especially with secondary c-kit overexpression and loss of tetraspanins. All this could modify the clinical outcome and impact the choice of first-line treatment in the future. Additionally, it is highlighted that intratumoural hypoxia can induce, via tumour-derived exosomes, angiogenesis and supplies oxygen and nutrients to cancer [ 5 ]. Because of an explicit rise of Imatinib chemoresistance, usually after two years of therapy, various studies are trying to explain pathomechanism involved. It seems that second, acquired, KIT mutation is mainly responsible for c-kit overexpression but, on the other hand, chemoresistance might result also from the changes of tetraspanins expression [ 8 – 10 ].

Studying clinical examples of therapies that impact survival without obvious early changes in the patients' tumor burden may provide insights into the patterns of response that may be observed in CSC targeting trials. In CML, inhibitors of BCR-ABL kinase activity, such as imatinib, have emerged as the standard of care because of their relative safety and ability to produce rapid responses ( 47 ). Prior to the advent of these agents, most CML patients were treated with alpha-interferon. Although fewer responses are seen with interferon and those that do occur may take several years to manifest, a significant proportion of patients achieving complete remissions remain disease-free when the drug is stopped ( 48 ). In contrast, virtually all patients treated with imatinib will relapse following its discontinuation ( 49 ). These observations may be explained by findings that interferon can eradicate CML stem cells in vitro, unlike imatinib that is primarily active against differentiated tumor cells and progenitors ( 50 , 51 ). It is possible that therapies, or combinations of agents, directed against both CSCs and differentiated cells can lead to long-term remissions as suggested by a recent study in which molecular remissions were maintained for several years after imatinib withdrawal in CML patients who received induction with imatinib and interferon ( 52 ). In breast cancer, HER2/ neu has been found to play a role in CSC self-renewal ( 53 ), and lapatinib, an inhibitor of HER2/ neu signaling, has been studied in a randomized trial in combination with the standard cytotoxic agent capecitabine ( 54 ).

Many of the translocations result in expression of oncogenic proteins; for example, 15–25% of childhood ALL cases have a translocation between chromosomes 12 and 21, t(12,21)(p13;q22), resulting in expression of the oncogenic ETV6-RUNX1 fusion protein. Much work has focussed on these translocations and specific treatments targeted to translocations/fusion proteins have had remarkable success, e.g. Imatinib mesylate effectively targets the BCR-ABL1 fusion resulting from the t(9,22)(q34;q11) translocation [ 6 ]. However despite being important drivers for leukaemia, these translocations can be detected in blood from neonates who do not go on to develop ALL [ 7 – 9 ], indicating that these fusion proteins alone are insufficient"

However, to our knowledge, small chemical inhibitors of PDGF-D have not been developed so far with proven anti-tumor efficacy in humans. Because PDGF-D exerts its function via activation of its receptor PDGFR-β, multiple small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that inactivate PDGFR have been reported 102 – 105 . For example, imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that interferes with the phosphorylation and activation of PDGFRβ, has been reported to inhibit cell growth and invasion in various cancer cell lines 106 .

More recently, dissection of the respective contributions of STAT5A and STAT5B in BCR-ABL-dependent transformation revealed that STAT5B, but not STAT5A, is a critical effector of BCR-ABL-driven leukemia development [ 54 ]. Besides survival- and growth-promoting effects, STAT5B facilitates leukemogenesis by suppressing IFN-α and IFN-γ signaling in these animal models. The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting BCR-ABL, such as imatinib mesylate (IM), has revolutionized the treatment of CML. However, imatinib mesylate (IM) is not totally curative and approximately 50% of patients remain therapy-free after IM discontinuation. The inability of IM to completely eradicate quiescent leukemic stem cells (LSCs) is probably responsible for the relapse of CML patients [ 55 ]. Moreover, the occurrence of BCR-ABL mutations in progressive or relapsed diseases"

It was also reported that NHERF1 elicited pharmacologic effect to enhance drug response of geftinib and imatinib in breast cancers [ 15 ]. In cervical cancer cells, NHERF1, as a putative interaction partner, reduced the stability of MRP4 by facilitating its internalization from cell surface to sensitize cisplatin-refractory [ 16 ].

CRCL-treated dendritic cells and macrophages resist Treg inhibition and retain the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immunostimulatory potential. However, a direct effect of CRCL on Treg seems to be unlikely since the survival of Treg, FoxP3 expression and immunosuppressive function is maintained following exposure to CRCL. Several chemotherapeutic agents (i.e. cyclophosphomide, imatinib mesylate) have been described as the negative modulators of Treg function further improving cancer vaccine efficacy. Adoptive transfer of allogeneic T cells may also increase the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy by providing adjuvant “danger” signals to the host immune cells. This effect partly stems from cytokine production by activated T lymphocytes,"

Its cutaneous adverse effects are diverse, including maculopapular exanthema, vasculitis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome 1 . A well-established pigmentary change is hypopigmentation, which is characterized by generalized skin lightening, vitiligo-like lesions, and hair graying 2 . However, paradoxical hyperpigmentary changes were rarely observed 3 , 4 . We present a case of hyperpigmentation of the nose and hard palate associated with imatinib mesylate. A 58-year-old man was referred for discoloration of the nose. He was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia and was treated with imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland). Not long after imatinib treatment, he noticed insidious pigmentary changes on his nose. He had no history of skin eruptions or use of other medication. Physical examination revealed an ill-defined, slate-gray patch on the nose and on the hard palate, which suggested a diagnosis of dermal pigmentary disorders including acquired bilateral nevus of Ota-like"

After 2 months of imatinib a decrease in tumor size was detected (panel B ). This analysis was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. Discussion We report on objective tumor responses we observed in two patients with locally advanced diffuse-type PVNS whom we treated with imatinib following lack of response to nilotinib. In the first case, response to imatinib was observed in a patient that initially got a tumor disease stabilization under nilotinib and further progressed (i.e. secondary resistance to nilotinib), while the second patient never responded to nilotinib (i.e. primary resistance to nilotinib). Imatinib is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor with activity against BCR-ABL, KIT, PDGFR, FLT3, RET, and CSFR1. No prospective studies on imatinib in PVNS are available, while a European phase 2 study on nilotinib, another CSF1R inhibitor, was completed in 2012, and results were preliminarily reported with [ 6 ].

PAI-1 antagonists are in clinical trials for inducing apoptosis in gastrointestinal and xenografted lung and skin cancers (Mutoh et al . 2008; Masuda et al . 2013). Fig. S4 Dasatinib is more senolytic than imatinib. Human subcutaneous preadipocytes were exposed to 10 Gy radiation 25 days before or were non-irradiated. Cells were plated at sub-confluent (50%) density at day 0 (=100%). After 3 days of exposure to dasatinib ( A ) or imatinib ( B ), ATPLite was used to assay viable cells. Note that by day 3, the proliferating cells had increased to ∼190% of plated cells at day 0, while senescent cells did not divide, remaining near 100%. The distance between the red lines (denoting senescent cells plated) and the data points corresponds to % senescent cells eliminated. Dasatinib caused a dose-dependent decrease in senescent cells to ∼50- of those plated, up to the concentration at which it also inhibited non-senescent cell viability (1000 nM), whereas imatinib did not reduce senescent cell viability more than that of proliferating cells at any concentration. Note that imatinib EC50 against cancer cells is ∼10 fold higher than dasatinib (O’Hare et al. 2005). N=4 independent experiments, means±SEM are shown.

Thus, for patients with one of these few specific mutations, the choice of second-line therapy is straightforward. For the majority of patients, other factors, such as patient history and concomitant conditions, must be considered when choosing between nilotinib and dasatinib after imatinib failure. Currently, the quantitative definition of a significant “rise” in BCR-ABL RNA (to warrant mutation analysis) is controversial and varies among laboratories. To directly address this issue, a 2.6-fold increase in transcript levels was recently shown to be the optimal cutoff for detecting concomitant BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations ( Table"

                    "inhibition on myometrial contractility c-kit is a transmembrane receptor that has been shown to be essential for the development and the maintenance of the IC phenotype in smooth muscle from the gastrointestinal tract [ 72 , 73 ]. As m-ICLC express c-kit, the next logical step for a number of investigators was to explore the effect of c-kit receptor inhibition on myometrial contractility. A c-kit receptor antagonist called imatinib mesylate (Glivec) [ 74 ] has been used to study the effects of c-kit inhibition on the in vitro contractility of myometrium from term pregnant rabbits. Only amplitude and not frequency was affected following the addition of imatinib and this occurred only at the highest dose studied (100 μM), whereas a dose of 10 μM had no effect [ 75 ]. This study was repeated with human myometrium obtained from term elective caesarean sections and again only the amplitude and not the frequency was affected (unpublished observation – Hutchings). In contrast, a different study using human myometrium obtained from benign non-pregnant hysterectomy specimens showed that the administration of imatinib led to a reduction in both amplitude and frequency with the eventual abolition of contractions after prolonged exposure (up to 180 min for 2 μM imatinib). Spontaneous contractions were restored after 30 min of washing with physiological saline. In a third study, imatinib decreased the frequency and amplitude of longitudinal but not circular contractions of the mouse uterus [ 76 ]. Data from studies of muscle from other organs have also led to conflicting conclusions. Three studies observed that imatinib leads to a decrease in contractile amplitude in guinea pig [ 77 ] and rat [ 2 ] detrusor muscle and in human intestine [ 78 ]. In another study, the addition of imatinib to smooth muscle from the gastrointestinal tract of mice abolished muscular activity in a dose-dependant manner from a concentration of between 9–27 μM up to a dose of 81 μM. The effect was reversed when the agent was washed from the tissue [ 79 ]. Following abolition of the contractions, the muscle was seen to be able to respond to depolarization following addition of potassium chloride. Two observations are evident from the results of these experiments. First, the doses of imatinib that were used are very high compared with either the IC50 concentrations (between 0.1 and 1 μM) or the serum levels achieved in humans receiving the drug (approximately 4 μM for peak levels and 2 μM for trough values [ 74 ]). This raises the possibility that any effect seen with these high doses could be as a result of non-specific effects rather than as a consequence of c-kit inhibition. Secondly, the results from the different studies fall into two broad groups. Either only amplitude is decreased at high doses of imatinib or imatinib has effects on both frequency and amplitude and leads to the eventual abolition of contractions. Perhaps these differences could be explained by differences in species or tissue type, but regarding the two human myometrial studies, there are no obvious differences in methodology that could account for the conflicting results. Popescu’s team used non-pregnant myometrium ( Fig. 9 ), but why this differs from pregnant myometrium is not easy to explain. Open in a separate window Fig 9 Representative traces of myometrial human smooth muscle inhibition by imatinib 20 μM. Reprinted from Ref. [ 78 ], with permission from Elsevier. Data from studies of the gastrointestinal tract has suggested that c-kit inhibition has a delayed effect taking up to 48 hrs to abolish electrical ‘slow-wave’ activity and to disrupt IC networks as imaged by immunohistochemistry [ 72 ]. In order to test for a delayed action on myometrium, the effect of a prolonged administration of imatinib of up to 14 days on myometrial contractility has been investigated in a study using pregnant rabbits [ 4 ]. However, no effect was observed on gestation at delivery and no difference in myometrial contractility in vitro was observed between treated and control rabbits. In summary, it does not appear"

Self-renewal and myeloproliferation become dependent on β-catenin in Irf8 -deficient animals that develop a CML-like disease. Combined Irf8 deletion and constitutive β-catenin activation result in progression of CML into fatal blast crisis, elevated leukemic potential of BCR-ABL–induced LICs, and Imatinib resistance. Interestingly, activated β-catenin enhances a preexisting Irf8 -deficient gene signature, identifying β-catenin as an amplifier of progression-specific gene regulation in the shift of CML to blast crisis. Collectively, our data uncover Irf8 as a roadblock for β-catenin–driven leukemia and imply both factors as targets in combinatorial therapy. \n Associated"

                    "in the recent years. Inhibition of signal transduction has become a viable and attractive avenue in biomedical cancer research based on the discovery of a large number of somatic mutations in many different types of cancer that lead to deregulated growth signal transduction and subsequent aberrant growth, invasion, tumor-derived angiogenesis and metastasis. Most of the noncytotoxic drugs that have been recently developed include Protein kinase inhibitors such as Gleevec, Iressa and Tarceva, Tyrosine kinase inhibitors like Leflunomide. Glivec™ (STI571), is an inhibitor of the bcr-abl kinase and CML. PKI166, on the other hand, is a dual inhibitor of EGF receptor (HER 1) as well as erbB (HER 2).

The substitution eliminates a critical oxygen molecule needed for hydrogen bonding between imatinib and the Abl kinase, and also creates steric hindrance to the binding of most tyrosine kinase inhibitors. An example BCR-ABL fusion protein (the b2a2 protein) sequence is set out below (SEQ ID NO:13). The position of the ABL amino acid corresponding to the ABLT315I mutation is shown in bold and"

The inhibitory effect was shown on nine tyrosine kinases, FGFR1, FGFR3, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, PDGFRβ, c-Kit, p60src, and FLT-3, as disclosed in WO 2005/047244.

During the last few years, thorough analysis of the mechanism underlying tyrosine kinase's activity led to novel cancer therapy using TKs blockers. These drugs are remarkably effective in the treatment of various human tumors including head and neck, gastric, prostate and breast cancer and leukemias. The most successful example of kinase blockers is Imatinib (Imatinib mesylate, Gleevec, STI571), the inhibitor of Bcr/Abl oncoprotein, which has become a first-line therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia. The introduction of STI571 for the treatment of leukemia in clinical oncology has had a dramatic impact on how this disease is currently managed. Others kinase inhibitors used recently in cancer therapy include Dasatinib (BMS-354825) specific for ABL non-receptor cytoplasmic kinase, Gefitinib (Iressa), Erlotinib (OSI-774, Tarceva) and Sunitinib (SU 11248, Sutent) specific for VEGF"

The article has sparked reactions that underscore the complexity of the issue, which encompasses questions of how drug values are determined, where moral boundaries are drawn and what mechanisms can be employed to reduce the divide between commercial interests and patient welfare. When the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (Gleevec/Glivec) was approved in the US in 2001, it cost $30,000 annually per patient. The initial price tag was expected to cover its development costs, and Novartis followed common marketing practice by fixing the price of imatinib slightly above that of interferon, then the standard of care for CML. However, the unexpected survival benefits conferred by imatinib prompted the company to hike the drug's price to $92,000 per annum by 2012. This probably set the pricing standard for newer drugs used to treat CML, including bosutinib (Pfizer), ponatinib (ARIAD Pharmaceuticals) and nilotinib (Novartis).

In addition, ginseng extract induced expression of CYP3A4 in human primary hepatocyte and increased CYP3A4-mediated luciferase activity in HepG2 cells expressing luciferase reporter gene with CYP3A4 promotor [57] . By contrast, the in vitro study showed that ginseng is capable of inhibiting CYP2C9- and CYP3A4-mediated metabolic reactions in human liver microsomes [58] . It was also reported that imatinib is a substrate of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 and imatinib is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 as well in vitro [59] . As a result, more cases are needed to support that notion that ginseng increases markedly the level of plasma concentration of imatinib which is able to cause severe hepatotoxicity. Thus, these notions may not be compatible with the author's claim that the imatinib–ginseng interaction is responsible for the hepatotoxicity of an individual who took imatinib and ginseng simultaneously for a long time. 7. Hypertension A case study reported that a 64-yr-old male who had never suffered hypertension taking 500 mg of the P. ginseng preparation Ginseng Forte-Dietisa for 13 d experienced a transient ischemic attack (amaurosis fugax) secondary to hypertensive crisis (195/95 mmHg).

In our case tumor was 12 cm in diameter with 1 mitotic figure per 50 HPF; so it was categorised under high risk category for recurrence and was given adjuvant therapy with Imatinib. Surgical resection is the gold standard treatment for non-metastatic GIST. It is important to completely remove the mass “enbloc” with the contiguous tissues with avoidance of tumor rupture and spillage. The prognosis for patients who have been diagnosed with GIST has changed with the identification of the KIT mutation’s association with tumor growth. Specific therapy targeting the kit receptor with Imatinib has resulted in improved prognosis for patients with unresectable, metastatic and recurrent disease [ 15 ]. To conclude, herein we reported this case as a rare presentation of GIST causing small bowel obstruction due to exophytic growth and should be included in the differential diagnosis of mesenteric mass to reduce"

The CYP2C8 is responsible for the oxidative metabolism of many clinically available drugs from a diverse number of drug classes, including thiazolidinedione and meglitinide antidiabetics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), antimalarials (e.g., amodiaquine, chloroquine), chemotherapeutics (e.g., taxanes, imatinib), and numerous other drugs ( Daily and Aquilante, 2009 ; Xiaoping et al., 2013 ; Zanger and Schwab, 2013 ). CYP2C8 is also involved in the endogenous metabolism of arachidonic acid and all- trans -retinoic acid to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and 4-hydroxy-all- trans -retinoic acid, respectively ( Zeldin et al., 1996"

EXAMPLE 1 Method The RNA Expression Profile Correlation Method Clinical samples were obtained from patients enrolled in a multi-national Phase III clinical trial (IRIS: International Randomized Study of Interferon-α vs. Imatinib) with newly diagnosed Ph + CML in chronic phase (CML-CP). Blood for RNA extraction was collected from more than 200 patients from multiple centers in the United States. Each of these patients signed a written pharmacogenetics informed consent form that was approved by local ethics committees. A total of 115 samples were collected at baseline, prior to drug treatment, from patients that were randomized to the Imatinib treatment arm. Ten of these samples were excluded from analysis due to early withdrawal of the patient from the study or because of very poor quality of the processed RNA. Of the remaining 105 samples, 88 samples were used as a “predictor” set to identify genes that could predict whether a patient would develop edema following Imatinib treatment, and 17 samples were used as a “test” set to validate the predictor genes. Clinical data for adverse events was evaluated following a minimum of 6 months of treatment with Imatinib. A patient was identified as having edema if they experienced at least one occurrence (regardless of grade) of edema as classified using the High Level Term (HLT) of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Terminology (MedDRA). Of the patients evaluated in this pharmacogenomics study, 43% (45 of 105) were classified as having experienced at least one episode of edema following treatment with Imatinib (Edema group), with the majority of these cases being periorbital edema (31%) and peripheral edema (19%).

Wolff Professor of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, said in a press release. 3 “The data are intriguing and promising, but we will need a much larger trial, perhaps with 300-500 patients over a longer period of time, to see if Gleevec can have an impact on asthma symptoms and quality of life.” Patients taking imatinib and a placebo experienced similar numbers of adverse events. However, patients taking imatinib were more likely to experience muscle cramps and low blood phosphate levels. One concern highlighted by the researchers noted imatinib’s effect on suppressing the immune system in patients taking the drug, which resulted in 1 patient stopping the trial due to low white blood cell counts. Although the results are promising, the researchers concluded that larger-scale studies over longer periods of time are needed to confirm imatinib’s efficacy for treating patients with severe asthma.

This article reviews the data supporting the use of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib in GIST patients, and how this treatment should be combined with surgical resection (when possible) to optimize patient outcomes. Although surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment for these tumors, patients with resected GISTs have high relapse rates that can be reduced by 1 year of adjuvant imatinib. Data also support the use of imatinib for patients with recurrent or unresectable GIST. In these patients the drug should be continued until progression, intolerance, or the patients are rendered resectable. Patients with advanced GIST who are successfully resected after imatinib treatment should be placed back on imatinib postoperatively. Patients who develop generalized progression (progression at 2 or more sites) on imatinib should move to other treatments, such as newer TKIs or other targeted approaches currently under study. Genotyping of the tumor should be considered in all pediatric GISTs and high risk adult GISTs, especially if there is progression on imatinib. Quality of life and the cost/benefit of new therapies are important issues for further study in patients with GIST.

Leukemia-specific signature of miRNAs suggests that epigenetic dysregulation of miRNAs is important for leukemogenesis. We focused on the role of DNA methylation of miR-203 which targets BCR-ABL1 mRNA. The microarray analysis showed that 48 miRNAs of CpG-rich 212 miRNAs were upregulated over 2-fold after imatinib treatment. Imatinib induced the demethylation of the miR-203 promoter region, resulting in low expression of targeted BCR-ABL1 gene, and loss of proliferation of leukemic cells. In conclusion, demethylation of miR-203 is one of the molecular mechanisms of imatinib-induced inhibition of BCR-ABL1-positive leukemic cells. \n                "

Central review of pathology was conducted by a neuropathologist at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (K.A.). Treatment Plan Imatinib was supplied by the National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Patients were treated with imatinib orally once (600 mg/day) or twice daily (800 mg/day). Patients initially received imatinib at a dose of 600 mg/day for the first 4-week cycle. If there were no significant treatment-related toxicities, the dose of imatinib was increased to 700 mg/day for the second 4-week cycle, and then to 800 mg/day for subsequent cycles. Eight patients received 700 mg/day as the maximum dose, and two patients received 800 mg/day. Pharmacokinetic Studies Heparinized venous blood samples (7 ml) were collected before and at 1, 2, 4, and 24 h after ingestion of imatinib on day 8 of cycle 1 and, if possible, at the same times on day 8 of cycle 3. If possible, blood samples were also obtained before imatinib ingestion on day 15 of cycles 1 and 3 and day 1 of cycles 2, 3, and 4. Blood samples were centrifuged immediately at 1,200 g for 5 min.

PGC-1α mRNA and protein is induced in primary adipocytes and adipose tissue in vivo by dasatinib In primary adipocytes from mice, dasatinib increased gene expression of PGC-1α by 60% ( Figure 2 A). Imatinib had no impact on PGC-1α mRNA in these primary adipocytes from mice. In addition, uncoupling protein (UCP)-1 expression increased 4-fold, suggesting that dasatinib treatment stimulated browning of primary adipocytes ( Figure 2 B). To investigate whether dasatinib also increased PGC-1α protein, we isolated nuclear fractionations from primary adipocytes and immunoblotted for PGC-1α protein. We found that 5μM–20μM dasatinib up-regulated nuclear PGC-1α protein without affecting TBP (control) expression ( Figure 2 C). We then tested the effect of dasatinib on adipose tissue in vivo to elucidate the relevance of our in vitro findings. We injected dasatinib or imatinib at the dose of 50-mg/kg body weight the day before, and again 4 hours before white adipose tissue (WAT) (epididymal WAT [eWAT]) was collected for analysis. PGC-1α mRNA expression increased 4-fold in response to dasatinib treatment, whereas imatinib did not affect PGC-1α mRNA expression ( Figure 2 D). Again, nuclear fractionation experiments revealed that PGC-1α protein was also up-regulated to a similar extend as by cold exposure, a known inducer of PGC-1α in mice ( Figure 2 E). This confirms our findings in vitro, that dasatinib, but not imatinib, exhibits PGC-1α mRNA and protein-inducing properties. The primer used to detect PGC-1α recognizes all PGC-1α isoforms so we next analyzed using isoform gene expression. The induction of PGC-1α could be attributed to a significant increased PGC-1α-1 and PGC-1α-4 mRNA ( Figure 2 , F and G) but not PGC-1α-3 ("

C-kit-positive GISTs are treated with surgery and/or imatinib. Imatinib is prescribed for patients with GISTs based on their risk of recurrence or metastasis, which is estimated using tumor size and the number of mitoses. In the stomach, for low-risk GISTs, which are less than 2 cm and have less than 5 mitoses per 50 HPF, a complete (R0) resection without rupturing is recommended. 13 Lymph node dissection is usually not recommended. For high-risk GISTs, which are larger than 2 cm or have more than 5 mitoses per 50 HPF, a complete resection, if possible, is recommended following adjuvant imatinib. For unresectable GISTs, neoadjuvant or palliative imatinib and/or surgery is recommended. 14 For c-kit-positive GISTs, 400 mg daily imatinib can be used for neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and palliative treatment. 15 , 16 Despite these treatment modalities, the 5-year survival rate o f c-kit-positive GISTs is known roughly to be 48% to 65%, and the tumors usually recur. The prognosis of GISTs depends on tumor size, the number of mitoses, chemotherapy, and complete resection. 17 On the other hand, the prognoses and predictive fa-c tors for prognosis of c-kit-negative GISTs remain unclear. However, complete resection and adjuvant imatinib, if possible, should be considered for c-kit-negative GISTs also because of the possibility of KIT or PDGFRA mutation, as in c-kitpositive GISTs. 18 Imatinib is a competitive inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, such as KIT and PDGFRA , 19 and several studies have shown that the c-kit-negative GISTs still have mutated KIT or PDGFRA despite the absence of IHC expression. 18 Therefore, surgery and imatinib should be used as a therapeutic strategy for c-kit-negative GISTs. In addition, some studies reported the effectiveness of imatinib. 7 However, c-kit-negative GISTs commonly have PDGFRA D842 mutations, and in such cases, imatinib resistance develops. 9 Thus, clinicians should consider this mutation when considering imatinib treatment for c-kitnegative GISTs. We reported on our patient with a c-kit-negative GIST. The tumor, which was located in the stomach, was completely resected in spite of its large size. The histological diagnosis was confirmed with DOG1 IHC staining. According to the indications for imatinib, the patient should have been treated with adjuvant imatinib, based on the risks of the tumor. However, the patient refused further evaluation and imatinib treatment for rpivate reasons. Recurrence has not yet developed, as of 9 months after surgery. If the patient is treated with adjuvant imatinib, a lower recurrence rate can be expected.

Recent studies have also identified SOCS1 as playing an important role in the regulation of APC’s function, since inhibition of this molecule by specific siRNA resulted in breaking of tolerance towards the self-antigen Trp2 ( 36 ). Furthermore, the demonstration that tyrosine phosphorylation of certain intracellular targets influences APC function ( 37 ), led us to evaluate the effects of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib Mesylate -an inhibitor of c-abl , c-kit and PDGFR tyrosine kinases- on the APC’s ability to prime rather than tolerize tumor-specific T cells ( 38 ). In vitro treatment of APCs with this drug enhanced the activation of naïve antigen-specific T-cells and restored the responsiveness of tolerant T-cells from tumor bearing hosts. More importantly, in vivo treatment with imatinib not only prevented the induction of tolerance in tumor-specific CD4 + T-cells, preserving their responsiveness to a subsequent immunization, but also resulted in enhanced vaccine efficacy ( 38 ). Molecular studies of imatinib-treated APCs showed that among all the known molecular targets of STI-571, inhibition of c-kit phosphorylation seems to"

In our experimental setup, we did not observe an increase in GPC, making this catabolic pathway more unlikely. The second catabolism pathway involves the action of PtdCho-specific phospholipase C. In our system, this is also not very likely as the reaction product, PC, does not increase, but drops after imatinib treatment. Considering the PtdCho anabolic pathway, as the cells are preparing to die, they could be reducing their uptake of choline; hence, less PtdCho would be synthesised. This would lead to an accumulation of DAGs, which could then be converted to TAGs to prevent the disruption of cellular metabolism. This"

Of the 22 patients with CHF symptoms, 11 continued imatinib therapy with dose adjustments and management for CHF symptoms without further complications. With the host of confounding factors involved in these patients, the occurrence of CHF in connection with imatinib use was reasonably unambiguous in only 7 of the 1,276 patients reviewed (0.5%). We conclude from our experience that imatinib therapy as a causal factor of CHF is rare. When seen, symptoms of CHF most frequently occur in elderly patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions and may often reflect predisposing cardiac compromise compounded by some element of fluid retention.

                    "leukemic DC was reduced slightly, mature bcr‐abl + monocyte‐derived DC exhibited potent immunostimulatory functions and promoted a strong polarization of naïve CD4 + T cells toward Th1. Therefore, our results are in line with those from Gabriele et al. [ 32 ], who found that bcr‐abl + monocyte‐derived DC were fully competent to stimulate CD8 + T cell responses. When DC maturation was initiated in the presence of imatinib, immunophenotypic changes and T cell immunostimulatory capacity of bcr‐abl + and normal monocyte‐derived DC were preserved, but IL‐12p70 secretion was decreased in a dose‐dependent manner, as also observed by Appel et al. [15] in normal monocyte‐derived DC. Nevertheless, we found that the capacity of imatinib‐treated DC to drive naive CD4 + T cell responses toward a Th1 profile was not affected in the experimental settings used in our study. Imatinib was reported recently to inhibit PHA and anti‐CD3‐driven human T cell proliferation in vitro [ 25 26 27 ] by targeting TCR signal transduction through the Abl and Lck tyrosine kinases [ 27 , 33 ]. Our data suggest that imatinib may also be detrimental to T cell expansion in vivo, as the proliferation of CD4 + T cells from imatinib‐treated CML patients upon PHA stimulation was decreased. Another striking finding in our study is that normal and bcr‐abl + monocyte‐derived DC were unable to overcome the antiproliferative effect of imatinib in vitro. Indeed, exposure to imatinib of CD4 + T cells cocultured with DC dramatically hampered T cell proliferation induced by normal and bcr‐abl + monocyte‐derived DC. It is interesting that imatinib did not inhibit DC‐mediated T cell activation, as CD4 + T cells from imatinib‐treated and untreated cultures demonstrated a similar increase in the T cell activation marker CD25. In turn, up‐regulation of the DC costimulatory molecule CD86 upon interaction with responding CD4 + T cells was not suppressed by imatinib. Altogether, our results show that imatinib does not prevent cognate interactions between DC and T cells and suggest that T cells and not monocyte‐derived DC are the main targets of imatinib‐suppressive action. However, we cannot exclude imatinib‐mediated modifications of the immunological DC‐T cell synapse. It is indeed important to keep in mind that imatinib was shown recently to alter the cross‐talk between DC and other immune effectors such as natural killer cells [ 34 ]. Moreover, the tyrosine kinase Abl, a target of imatinib, is critical for optimal neuronal and neuromuscular synapse formation [ 35 ], and neurological and immunological synapses share many similarities [ 35 36 37 ]. Further research is needed to understand how imatinib may affect immunity more generally and to determine how immunological control of CML in imatinib‐treated patients can be achieved and how imatinib should be integrated in the treatment of residual disease in the post‐transplantation setting. Our findings readily demonstrate progress toward the clinical applicability of DC vaccines in imatinib‐treated patients. As a result of imatinib‐induced suppression of T cell proliferation, imatinib‐free therapeutic windows during monocyte‐derived DC vaccination may be required to enable"

                    "myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a type of myeloproliferative disorder characterized by uncontrolled clonal expansion of immature granulocytes and their precursors ( 1 ). CML is believed to stem from the malignant transformation of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) triggered by a fusion gene BCR-ABL because of a reciprocal chromosomal translocation t(9,22)(q34;q11) ( 2 ). Most adult patients with chronic-phase CML respond well to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib mesylate (IM; ref. 3 ). However, acquired resistance to IM conferred by multiple mechanisms [e.g., BCR-ABL mutations ( 4 ), leukemia stem cells (LSC; ref. 5 )] is an emerging problem. In addition, BCR-ABL–positive pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and adult accelerated phase- or blast-crisis-CML usually respond poor to TKIs ( 6"

Clinical and follow-up data of 24 recurrent GIST patients with high recurrence risk receiving imatinib standard dose reintroduction(400 mg/d or 600 mg/d) after stopping imatinib adjuvant treatment more than 3 months in Department of GI Oncology of Peking University Cancer Hospital from August 2005 to January 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The objective response rate(ORR), relapse-free survival(RFS) of imatinib reintroduction were evaluated and the difference of efficacy in patients receiving different imatinib adjuvant therapy duration were compared. Of 24 patients, 21 were male and 3 were female. The median age was 53 years(39-72 years). Mutation detection of tumor tissues before imatinib therapy showed 20 patients had c-Kit exon 11 mutation,3 patients exon 9 mutation and 1 patient c-Kit/PDGFRA wild type mutation. The median recurrence time was 14 months in all the patients (95%CI:7.9-20.0) and in those patients receiving imatinib adjuvant therapy for 1 or 2 years (9 patients in each group, 95%CI:11.1-16.9 and 8.2-19.8 respectively). The median recurrence time of 3 patients receiving imatinib adjuvant therapy for 3 years was 24, 41 and 54 months respectively. Of 2 patients receiving imatinib adjuvant therapy for 5 years, the median recurrence time was 4 and 18 months. Only one patient received imatinib adjuvant therapy for 6 years, and the recurrence time was 6 months. Twenty patients with exon 11 mutation and 1 patient with wide type received imatinib treatment at a dose of 400 mg daily, and 3 patients with exon 9 mutation received the dosage of 600 mg per day. Among the patients receiving imatinib reintroduction, 11 patients(45.8%) got partial response(PR), 12 patients(50.0%) had stable disease and 1 patient had progression disease. The response rate in patients receiving imatinib adjuvant therapy for 1 year(6/9, 67%) was significantly higher than that in patients receiving adjuvant therapy for ≥2 years(3/15, 20%)(P=0.036). The median progression-free survival (PFS) of imatinib reintroduction was 31 months in all the patients(95%CI:23.6-38.4). The median PFS in patients receiving imatinib adjuvant therapy for 1 year(9 cases), 2 years (9 cases) and ≥3 years (6 cases) was 50 months(95%CI:27.3-72.7), 26 months(95%CI:10.7-41.3) and fall short of median PFS. No significant difference was observed among three groups(P=0.295). Imatinib reintroduction is still effective to GIST after imatinib adjuvant therapy failure. The different imatinib adjuvant therapy duration can influence the benefit of imatinib reintroduction. \n                               \n                                                                "

Immunoblotting of actin was used as a loading control. The effect of MegaFasL on imatinib-induced apoptosis Following the identification of MegaFasL as a potent apoptosis-inducing agent in GIST cells, we investigated its effect in combination with imatinib. GIST882 pretreatment with MegaFasL followed by the addition of imatinib, appeared to be the most effective schedule. In this way, low concentrations of MegaFasL for 24 h followed by the addition of imatinib for another 24 h substantially increased the amount of apoptosis compared to levels seen with either MegaFasL or imatinib treatments alone ( Figure 2A ). When imatinib was administered before MegaFasL, no synergistic but rather an additive effect was observed (data not shown).

We therefore also evaluated the combination of MegaFasL and imatinib in GIST48 by using the same treatment schedule as GIST882. As in GIST882, synergistic apoptosis induction was seen for the combination of MegaFasL and imatinib, although higher concentrations of MegaFasL were necessary to induce a substantial amount of apoptosis ( Figure 2B ).

                    "patients, resulting in a median survival of only 1 to 2 years. 27 Standard cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens have shown significantly dire response rates (0%–5%) for unresectable or metastatic disease. 67 – 72 Treatment of these tumors was revolutionized, however, by the subsequent finding that mutational activation of KIT or PDGFRA stimulated their growth. This led to the development of specific small molecule inhibitors of tyrosine kinase such as imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) and sunitinib malate. Two major phase III trials have shown, in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST, response rates of about 50% and 1-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates of about 70% and 85%, respectively, with imatinib. 73 , 74 The results of these studies led to the 2001 FDA approval of imatinib mesylate for first-line use with metastatic or unresectable GISTs. 75 Recent long-term results have shown that nearly 50% of patients with advanced GISTs treated with imatinib survived for more than 5 years. 76 Patients who are intolerant or resistant to imatinib may respond to sunitinib malate (Sutent), which is also an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is less specific than imatinib. Sunitinib was FDA approved in January 2006 as second-line use in patients with advanced GIST. 14 In addition to primary therapy for unresectable and metastatic disease, imatinib mesylate is also recommended as neoadjuvant therapy for both large tumors and poorly positioned small GISTs that may be considered marginally resectable on technical grounds. 14 , 77 – 82 For primary localized resectable GISTs, standard of care is surgery followed by postoperative radiologic surveillance. 14 Unfortunately, previous studies have shown that only about 50% of all patients with localized resectable GISTs remain free of recurrence after 5 years, despite complete tumor resection. 27 , 83 – 93 Several large studies have recently been launched to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant imatinib for tumor recurrence. Preliminary reports from a phase III trial conducted by the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group are encouraging. In patients with a completely resected GIST at least 3 cm in maximal diameter who received 1 year of adjuvant imatinib vs. placebo, the recurrence rate was only 3% vs. 17% after a median of 14 months. 94 Surgery may also have a role in recurrent or metastatic disease in patients with stable disease or with limited disease progression on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (imatinib or sunitinib). Data from several studies have led the National Comprehensive Cancer Network to recommend surgery for 1) disease that is stable or shrinking on TKI therapy when complete gross resection is possible; 2) isolated areas of progressive disease on TKI therapy after initial response (indicative of secondary drug resistance), while other sites of disease remain stable (limited disease progression); or 3) emergencies including hemorrhage, perforation, obstruction, or abscess. Patients with widespread or diffuse disease progression on TKI therapy (generalized disease progression) should have their imatinib dose increased, have their TKI switched to sunitinib, or be enrolled in clinical trials. 14 In patients with isolated liver metastases, but multifocal bilobar disease precluding hepatic resection, hepatic artery chemo-embolization may also have some therapeutic benefit. 95 – 97 \n                  "

The chromatographic system was coupled to a Shimadzu LCMS-2020 MS with an electrospray ionization interface. Preparation of calibration standards and quality controls Standard stock solutions of imatinib and tamsulosin were prepared in pure methanol by dissolving a specified amount of material, weighed with a precision of 0.1 mg, in a suitable volume of solvent to provide a 1 mg/mL base equivalent clear solution after sonication. Working solutions were prepared by serial dilutions of the stock solutions to obtain final concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 90, 120, 160, 162, and 200 μg/mL for imatinib and 5 μg/mL for tamsulosin. All stock solutions were stored at −20°C, and working solutions were stored at 2°C–8°C until use. Serum calibrators and quality controls were prepared as 20-fold dilutions of the working solutions in blank (drug-free) serum to obtain a calibration curve at concentrations of 0.500, 1.00, 2.00,",

The method was fully validated according to FDA and ANVISA regulations, including selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, LLOD, LLOQ, recovery, and stability. Given that the validation parameters meet the criteria recommended by regulatory agencies, particularly the FDA and ANVISA, the method may be applied for routine quantitative determination of imatinib. The proposed method is sufficiently robust, accurate, precise, and selective for quantitative bioanalyses of imatinib in human serum, therapeutic drug monitoring, or pharmacokinetic assays in which serum imatinib levels range from 0.155 μg/mL to 10.0 μg/mL. Stability tests have demonstrated that imatinib is stable in actual conditions. The simplicity, rapid nature, and low cost of this method allow laboratories to implement routine analysis of imatinib using HPLC-MS instrumentation in clinical centers with at least three-fold cost savings. Considering the results of the clinical studies mentioned above, evaluation of blood imatinib levels in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia has become a useful tool to achieve the optimum therapeutic level for those patients who experience drug interactions or adverse effects or those who require dose adjustment. The characteristics and performance of this validated method make it suitable for this clinical purpose. This method may also be suitable for pharmacokinetic analyses because the LLOQ is suitable to quantify imatinib over three half-lives, which is sufficient for single-dose or steady-state monitoring.

Both treatments induce the phosphorylation of HSF-1 to a similar level in K562-s and K562-r, as detected by the appearance of a third higher molecular band, but this was not accompanied by an increase in the level of expression of the Hsp70 protein owing to the shorter time point used in our experiment. Inhibition of Hsp70 expression by siRNA decreases imatinib resistance The results above suggested that overexpression of Hsp70 in K562-r could underlie its imatinib-resistant phenotype allowing to grow in the continuous presence of 1 μ M imatinib. To test this hypothesis, an siRNA specific for Hsp70 was designed and used to inhibit Hsp70 expression in K562-r. These cells were transfected with either the Hsp70 or the control siRNA. Twelve hours after transfection, more than 90% of cells contained the siRNA ( Figure 2a ). A small but significant difference in the proportion of dead cells (propidium iodine-labeled cells, B2+B4, 16.5 versus 9.1%) was measured between the Hsp70 siRNA and the control transfected cells, showing that inhibition of 30% of Hsp70 decreased the viability of K562-r by 10% in the presence of imatinib. In comparison to the controls (no siRNA or control siRNA), the siRNA targeting Hsp70 led to a rapid decrease of Hsp70 expression, which fell less than 10% at day 4 ( Figure 2b ). Viability was reduced to 85% in K562-r transfected with Hsp70 siRNA at day 1 and reached 66±6% at day 4 ( n =5, P \u003c0.05) in comparison to controls ( Figure 2c ). These results show that inhibition of Hsp70 expression in K562-r partially restores the sensitivity to imatinib, confirming the role of Hsp70 in the in vitro resistance to imatinib of this cell line. Moreover, viability of Hsp70 siRNA-transfected K562-r is not modified in the absence of imatinib (not shown). In parallel, the inhibition of Hsp70 by siRNA in K562-s does not affect viability and does not change significantly the sensitivity to imatinib (not shown). Figure 2 Inhibition of Hsp70 overexpression in K562-r cells by siRNA restores sensitivity to imatinib. K562-r cells (2 × 10 6 ) in the exponential growing phase (day 0) were transfected with no siRNA (control), 5 μ g Alexa-488-labeled control siRNA (siRNA Neg) or 5 μ g Alexa-488-labeled siRNA Hsp70 (siRNA Hsp70). After recovery (4 h after transfection), 1 μ M of imatinib was added in the culture medium. Every day (d1–d4) an aliquot was taken for counting cell viability using trypan blue exclusion, propidium iodine labeling and detection of Hsp70 expression level by Western blotting.

                    "Download PDF Peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD) is an emerging adverse event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients treated with nilotinib. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 The largest published cohort of CML patients treated with nilotinib comes from the phase III ENESTnd trial (Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in Clinical Trials - newly diagnosed patients), which compared nilotinib (300 or 400 mg BID) to standard therapy with imatinib (400 mg). From the 3-year follow-up analysis published in 2012, 8 patients out of 556 (1.4%) in the nilotinib arm were identified as having PAOD. 5 This figure does not take into account three patients reported in the 2-year analysis as having PAOD, but who were removed from the 3-year analysis as a result of changes in the AE search algorithm. 6 When these three patients are included, 11 patients out of 556 (2.0%) can be considered as having PAOD compared to no cases among the 280 patients treated in the imatinib arm. Two recent reports analyzed more closely the relative incidence of PAOD in nilotinib-treated patients. 7 , 8 The first reviewed POAD cases reported in three trials (IRIS, TOPS and ENESTnd) and generated three groups of patients: those not exposed to tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( n =553), those exposed to imatinib ( n =1301) and those exposed to nilotinib ( n =556). PAOD incidence was 0.6%, 0.2% and 1.3% in these groups, respectively. 7 In the second academic study, 129 CML patients treated with imatinib or nilotinib were prospectively screened for PAOD using the ankle-brachial index (ABI). 8 In this cohort, the incidence of PAOD was far higher than the previously reported data (6.3% with first-line imatinib, 26.0% with first-line nilotinib and 35.7% with second-line nilotinib), with a higher cumulative incidence in patients at high risk for vascular disease than that in low-risk patients. Despite these reports, little is known about PAOD improvement after nilotinib discontinuation. We report a case of severe PAOD observed in a CML"

Molecular characterizations of recurrent translocations in lymphoid malignancies have led to the discovery of key oncogenes (e.g. C-MYC) and the development of targeted therapeutic approaches (e.g. Gleevec targeting BCR-ABL1).

Duration of Response Duration of response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR until the first date that progression is objectively documented. Statistical Considerations Treatment and Study Rationale Initially all patients will be started at imatinib 400 mg per day, as soon as the genotyping reveals negative KIT exon 11 mutation, the dose will be increased to 800 mg per day. Imatinib will be administered until progression. PEG-intron will be administered at 4 mcg/kg subcutaneously weekly×7 weeks, and then decreased to 1 mcg/kg subcutaneously weekly thereafter for 49 weeks.

                    "another embodiment, the compounds of the invention can be administered to patients whose cancer has become resistant to a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (e.g., gefitinib or erlotinib). In this embodiment, the compounds of the invention can be administered either alone or in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In another embodiment, the compounds of the invention are useful for treating patients with hematological cancers that have become resistant to Imatinib, a chemotherapeutic agent that acts by inhibiting tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-Abl. In patients with CML in the chronic phase, as well as in a blast crisis, treatment with Imatinib typically will induce remission. However, in many cases, particularly in those patients who were in a blast crisis before remission; the remission is not durable because the Bcr-Abl fusion protein develops mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain that cause it to be resistance to Imatinib. (See Nimmanapalli, et al., Cancer Research (2001), 61:1799-1804; and Gorre, et al., Blood (2002), 100:3041-3044, the entire teachings of each of these references are incorporated herein by reference). Compounds of the invention act by inhibiting the activity of Hsp90 which disrupt Bcr-Abl/Hsp90 complexes. When Bcr-Abl is not complex to Hsp90 it is rapidly degraded. Therefore, compounds of the invention are effective in treating Imatinib resistant leukemias since they act through a different mechanism than Imatinib. Compounds of the invention can be administered alone or with Imatinib in patients who have a Bcr-Abl associated cancer that is not resistant to Imatinib or to patients whose cancer has become resistant to Imatinib. Anticancer agents that can be co-administered with the compounds of the invention include Taxol™, also referred to as “paclitaxel”, is a well-known anti-cancer drug which acts by enhancing and stabilizing microtubule formation, and analogs of Taxol™, such as Taxotere™. Compounds that have the basic taxane skeleton as a common structure"

Assaying for differential expression of at least one of the biomarkers in Table 2 can be done after prolonged treatment with any chemotherapeutic to determine if the cancer is sensitive to the MDM2i. For example, kinase inhibitors such as Gleevec® will strongly inhibit a specific kinase, but may also weakly inhibit other kinases.

Conventional imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) tablets produce rapid and relatively high peak blood levels and requires frequent administration to keep the plasma drug level at an effective range. This might cause side effects, reduced effectiveness and poor therapeutic management. Therefore, floating sustained-release Imatinib tablets were developed to allow the tablets to be released in the upper part of the GIT and overcome the inadequacy of conventional tablets.Floating sustained-release Imatinib mesylate tablets were prepared using the wet granulation method. Tablets were formulated using Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC K4M), with Sodium alginate (SA) and Carbomer 934P (CP) as release-retarding polymers, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) as the effervescent agent and lactose as a filler. Floating behavior, in vitro drug release, and swelling index studies were conducted. Initial and total drug release duration was compared with a commercial tablet (Gleevec) in 0.1 N HCl (pH 1.2) at 37 ± 0.5°C for 24 hours. Tablets were then evaluated for various physical parameters, including weight variation, thickness, hardness, friability, and drug content. Consequently, 6 months of physical stability studies and in vitro gastro-retentive studies were conducted.Statistical data analysis revealed that tablets containing"

Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) have emerged as potent vehicles for this purpose. Herein, we demonstrate CPP- like properties of two peptides: NH2-SGASDDEEIAR-COOH (SR11) and NH2-ICSSHYEPTVRIGGR-COOH (IR15), derived from the tryptic digest of Abrus precatorius agglutinin. Both IR15 and SR11 were found to be non-toxic at lower doses (up to 50 μg/ml). These two peptides entered into HeLa cells through lipid raft-mediated endocytosis within 15 min and penetrated the nuclear membrane in 60 min of incubation. Co-treatment of peptides (20 μg/ml) and Imatinib (5 μM) in HeLa cells increased uptake of the drug by ∼ 55% and lowered the IC50 value to one-third in comparison to the drug added exclusively. However, co-treatment of TAT peptide (standard CPP) did not alter the Imatinib uptake significantly. In summary, we have identified two novel CPPs from tryptic digest of Abrus agglutinin which increased the cellular uptake of Imatinib upon co-administration. Further studies may result in deciphering a novel mode of drug delivery. \n                               \n                                      "

The remarkable results of imatinib mesylate in clinical trials have rapidly and profoundly changed the management of patients with CML. This article will review the development of this molecularly targeted agent. The clinical trials with imatinib mesylate will be summarised along with the pharmacology of this agent. Despite the impressive responses seen in chronic-phase patients, numerous questions remain. For example, how durable will responses to imatinib mesylate be and is it necessary or possible to improve upon these results? Ongoing efforts to address these issues will be discussed. \n                               \n                        "

International criteria (WHO and Recist) have been promulgated and are overall well accepted. However, several authors drew the attention on different limitations. Some are more obvious in patients receiving a targeted therapy. The largest experience has been accumulated in patients with GIST, treated with imatinib. It became apparent that tumour size was not an early predictor of tumour response, while structural and perfusion modifications were readily observed. Meanwhile, modern imaging techniques like US, CT and MRI improved in functional and perfusion analysis, putting efforts on the vascular and interstitial compartments of the tumour that could"

Another difference between the conformation of the protein in the NVP-AEG082 complex and the imatinib complex is the relative position of the N- and C-terminal lobes of the kinase. There is a shift of main-chain atoms in the N-terminal lobe as great as 2.6 Å between the two structures.

In 8 MTC patients treated with imatinib, all of whom had previously undergone thyroidectomy, marked elevations in TSH up to a mean of 384% + 228% of the upper limit were noted.( de Groot, et al. 2005 ). Free T4 was decreased but generally remained within the reference range. Despite doubling the average dosage of levothyroxine, thyroid functions were normalized in only 3 out of 8 patients. The authors described associated symptoms that could be considered consistent with hypothyroidism, including fatigue and edema (47). However, the authors pointed out that it was difficult to distinguish whether these were caused by hypothyroidism, other underlying disease, or imatinib itself. Interestingly, in this initial description of thyroid dysfunction associated with TKIs, the patients had no thyroid glands (since they had undergone thyroidectomies for their tumors), therefore “thyroid dysfunction” could be better described as “alterations in TSH and free T4” or “worsening post-surgical hypothyroidism,” because the thyroid gland itself could not be implicated in the pathophysiology. One study evaluating the thyroid function of 68 patients with CML and intact thyroid glands who received imatinib did not find any adverse effect on thyroid function, suggesting that perhaps the effect of imatinib was unique to patients surgically rendered athyroid ( Dora, et al. 2008 ). Motesanib, a TKI with inhibitory effects on VEGFR, PDGFRA, c-kit and RET, was also associated with marked exacerbation of post-surgical hypothyroidism in a phase II thyroid cancer trial. In this study, 60-70% of patients exhibited elevated TSH"

The identification of dasatinib as a lead compound was a direct result of researchers' learning the molecular explanation for why patients develop resistance to Gleevec. Sawyers noted that just as Gleevec was developed as a molecularly targeted inhibitor, the next generations of kinase inhibitors, which include dasatinib, are being refined and improved by structural biology studies that show how the drugs “fit” with their target, and how mutations alter the shape of that target. In this case, the target of both Gleevec and dasatinib is the Abelson tyrosine kinase (ABL), an enzyme that becomes overactivated by a chromosomal mix-up that occurs during blood cell development. The genes ABL and BCR, which are located on different chromosomes, become fused and express a hybrid BCR-ABL enzyme that is always active. The hyperactive BCR-ABL, in turn, drives the overproliferation of white blood cells that is the hallmark of CML. Dasatinib differs from Gleevec in that it is a “sloppier inhibitor” that does not hold its target to such tight structural constraints. There are currently about 50 known Gleevec-resistance mutations, each of which hampers Gleevec's ability to bind to its target, the ABL kinase. In the case of both Gleevec and dasatinib, there appears to be one particular mutation, known as T315I, which does not respond to either therapy. “That mutation will likely require a different drug, and researchers are working on that now,” said Sawyers. Sawyers, who in addition to being a researcher, also sees cancer patients at UCLA, has long been hunting for an explanation of Gleevec resistance. The development of dasatinib is deeply rooted in scientific literature spanning several different fields, including molecular oncology and structural biology. “This is the first drug to get around kinase resistance, and that has broad implications for CML and other cancers,” Sawyers said. “One could envision using dasatinib in a"

A particularly striking feature of the process according to the invention is that the product can be obtained in the desired form without resorting to seeding, which is required for producing the beta-form as disclosed in WO9903854. The process of the present invention is very suitable for industrial application, particularly as a pharmaceutical. The imatinib mesylate according to the invention is suitable for use in therapy. It is useful in methods of treating cancer, particularly leukaemia (most commonly chronic myeloid leukaemia) and GIST. It is also useful in the manufacture of a medicament for treating such diseases. A stress study was performed on the alpha form of Imatinib Mesylate by using various conditions, such as exposure to higher temperatures, for example 60° C. for 48 hours, 105° C. for 12 hours, and UV 45° C. at 75% RH for a period of 12 hours. The study showed that the alpha imatinib mesylate produced in accordance with the present invention is quite stable as indicated Table 2 wherein there is no increase in the level of impurities before and after stability study and the product is polymorphically stable when DSC and XRPD evaluation was performed on both the samples. The product on storage was found to be stable chemically and polymorphically at ambient temperature. Unlike many substances, which lose their polymorphic identity when subjected to stress conditions such as milling or heating, the alpha-crystals of imatinib mesylate retain the polymorphic identity thus confirming its stability under stress conditions.

Excessive orbital fibroblast activation by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB contributes to GO. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) imatinib mesylate and dasatinib both target PDGF-receptor tyrosine kinase activity, albeit with a different potency. We compared the efficacy of these TKIs on PDGF-BB-induced proliferation, and on cytokine and hyaluronan production by orbital fibroblasts. Also the capacity of dasatinib to suppress GO-associated gene expression in orbital tissue was examined. Orbital fibroblasts from"

(Hochhaus et al , 2009 ) CML was previously an aggressive malignant disease with high mortality that has become a chronic condition with complete remission and a much longer life expectancy when treated with TKI. (Kantarjian et al , 2003 ; Bjorkholm et al , 2011 ) In vitro studies have shown an inhibitory effect of the TKI imatinib on osteoclast activity and proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells, and CML patients treated with imatinib have changes in bone turnover markers. (Berman et al , 2006 ) Nevertheless, clinical observations with prospective data from imatinib‐treated CML patients indicated that bone mineral density (BMD) was stable over a 4‐year observation period. (O'Sullivan et al , 2011 , 2013 ; Jonsson et al , 2012 ) In line with these studies, the fracture rates were similarly elevated before and after the universal introduction of imatinib treatment for our CML cohort.

Fifteen male and four female patients had a median age of 8 (range 4-15) years at relapse or induction failure. Patients received imatinib in combination with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) and methotrexate and cytarabine (MTX/Ara-C) (n = 9), imatinib in combination with other chemotherapy (n = 5), chemotherapy without imatinib (n = 2), imatinib alone (n = 2), or no additional chemotherapy (n = 1). Two patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) without achieving complete remission (CR) and died of leukemia. The remaining 17 patients achieved CR with salvage therapies and underwent HSCT whilst in CR: 10 patients remain alive in CR, five died of transplantation-related complications, and two died of relapse. In six of seven patients with available data on minimal residual disease (MRD), imatinib in combination with the first course of hyper-CVAD was more effective in achieving a favorable MRD response compared with the Ph+ ALL04 induction regimen. This study suggested that cross-resistance to imatinib failed to develop after conventional chemotherapy.

In cardiac allograft arteriosclerosis , PDGF may serve as a migration and proliferation signal for SMC and their progenitors invading the intima. In our study, only PDGF-BB-induced a strong SMC migration and proliferation in vitro, which was completely inhibited with imatinib. The role of PDGF-AA may be underestimated in the current study because prestimulation with inflammatory cytokines may be needed for PDGF–AA-induced SMC effects ( 16 ). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors PTK787 and imatinib also inhibit receptors other than VEGFR or PDGFR. Imatinib also inhibits Bcr-Abl and c-kit, which is clinically used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumor, respectively ( 20 ). In addition to VEGFR inhibition, PTK787 with higher concentrations can inhibit other class III kinases, such as PDGFR-β tyrosine kinase, c-Kit, and c-Fms ( 19 ). Although PTK787 and imatinib had distinctive functions mediated through VEGF and PDGF, we cannot rule out that inhibition of other receptors might also play a role in our study. Because PTK787 partially inhibited PDGF–BB-induced SMC effects, it is possible that some of the beneficial effects of PTK787 on intimal growth in vivo is attributed to its PDGFR inhibition properties. Nevertheless, in consideration of the different effects on graft inflammation and SMC migration and proliferation for PTK787 and imatinib and the better effect on cardiac allograft arteriosclerosis when given in combination, PTK787 and imatinib may have distinctive mechanisms through VEGFR and PDGFR inhibition in our model. In conclusion, induction of VEGF and PDGF in cardiac allografts may provide a stimulus for inflammation , arterial remodeling, and SMC proliferation.

Another significant hallmark of imatinib sensitivity revealed by 31 P-NMR was an increase in phosphodiester signals, such as glycerophosphocholine (GPC) and glycerophosphoethanolamine (GPE), which are the degradation products of membrane phospholipids. Both GPC and GPE concentrations were greatly increased in LAMA84-s and K562-s cells after the 24 h incubation with 1µM imatinib, when compared with untreated cells ( Table 1 , Figure 3A ). Increased catabolism of membrane phospholipids revealed increased apoptotic processes in sensitive cells treated with imatinib ( Figure 3D ). As a consequence, the ratios of PC/GPC were markedly decreased in sensitive, imatinib-treated cells ( Table 1 , Figures 3B ). In contrast, all three resistant cell lines showed an increased PC/GPC ratio compared with untreated sensitive counterparts and even more so when compared with treated"

Results Mean operative time was 1h 29 min±92 (40-420 min). Average lenght of hospital stay was three days (2-6 days). There were no leaks, postoperative bleeding or need for reintervention. Mean postoperative follow-up was 38±17 months (6-60 months). Three patients underwent adjuvant Imatinib treatment, one for recurrence five months postoperatively and two for tumors with moderate risk for recurrence . Conclusion Laparoscopic GIST resection, not only for small lesions but also for tumors above 5 cm, is safe and acceptable technique.

The initiation of pTyr phosphorylation in sKin-Abl occurs within minutes, suggesting rapid assembly of the fragments. However, we cannot be sure activation for the natural cAbl is not faster since sKin-Abl needs to assemble from existing fragments. We engineered the gatekeeper T315I mutation into sKin-Abl to make it resistant to the pharmacological inhibition by imatinib. Addition of imatinib did not change the pTyr profiles significantly ( Figure S4 ). Thus, the endogenous imatinib-sensitive pool is either far less active, or, like the engineered sKin-Abl, is largely confined to the cytosol. Distinguishing among these possibilities will require further research. The highly quantitative aspect of NeuCode SILAC allowed precise estimates"

Surgery remains the standard treatment for primary resectable EGISTs. Whenever possible, complete en bloc removal of the tumor and the surrounding organs that are involved is required. The available methods include radical prostatectomy, cystoprostatectomy and total pelvic exenteration. Conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy are ineffective in the treatment of EGISTs and GISTs, whereas Imatinib myesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of c kit, and PDGFRA as methods of adjuvant therapy, have been proposed as treatment for advanced, unresectable and metastatic GIST.

                    "a secondary malignancy was lower than expected (observed to expected ratio 0.6; 95% confidence interval 0.44–0.81), dispelling concerns over the potential link between exposure to TKI therapy and the development of secondary malignancies [ Verma et al . 2011 ]. With regard to adherence to TKI therapy in CML, observational study results have differed widely. A single-center study in Sweden, which included 38 patients with CML treated with imatinib, revealed a self-reported Morisky (mean) score of 12.3 on a scale of 1–13, with higher scores indicative of better adherence. Predictors of high adherence included patients feeling well informed about their treatment and taking an active part in treatment decisions, and follow-up with a single hematologist [ Jonsson et al",
                    "in socioeconomic factors, such as therapy adherence, medical literacy and access to medical care, between the two settings [ Pulte et al . 2011 ]. However, a prospective population-based cohort conducted by the UK’s Haematological Malignancy Research Network revealed that survival rates in patients with CML in clinical practice was comparable with those reported in clinical trials. In a sample of 242 patients with CML, treated mainly with imatinib, the 5-year survival rate was 89.1% and 90.1% for men and women, respectively. This suggests that disparities seen in the US may reflect financial barriers to accessing TKI therapy. The study also revealed that, despite having access to TKI therapy, clinical outcomes were poorer in patients from lower socioeconomic groups in the UK; this is thought to be the result of differences in therapy adherence in these groups [ Smith et al . 2014 ]. An analysis using data from the Glivec International Patient Assistance Program has also revealed that there are significant differences in age of diagnosis and OS between different geographic regions. An analysis of 33,985 patients with CML low- and middle-income countries showed that CML was diagnosed at a much earlier age in these countries compared with the US"

This may be caused by the differences in the position of flavonoid glycosylation and substituents, for instance, ECG and EGCG (with gallate moiety) showed more potency in the uptake inhibition when compared to (+)-catechin, EGC, and EC (without gallate moiety) [ 112 ]. In our study, it is most probably that the resulted effect on the pharmacokinetics of imatinib and N -desmethyl imatinib is caused by a combination of multiple kinetic pathways that significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of imatinib and N -desmethyl imatinib, other than CYP3A-dependent pathways. For example, the involvement of uptake and efflux transporters’ inhibition in different tissues could be the reason for the shown decreased exposure of imatinib. However, the aforementioned inconsistency between different in vivo and in vitro experiments may be due to the differences in the extracts used and therefore their components [ 64 ]. Moreover, the presence of multiple metabolic pathways indicates that the characterization of these pathways requires multiple in vivo models, and a"

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments of the Invention Examples of Cancer Cell Inhibition In Vitro Example 1 To assess the in vitro sensitivity of poorly proliferating (MCF-7) and fast proliferating (MDA-468) breast cancer cell lines, cells were cultivated for 48 hours in the presence of 10 µM imatinib (a proprietary tyrosine kinase inhibitor) alone, with trioxane T7 (1 µM) alone, and 10 µM imatinib and 1 µM trioxane T7 together. The same experimental set-up was also utilized to test the synergistic capacity of trioxane T59 with imatinib. As a reminder, the structure of trioxane T59 is as follows: The controls included the naturally occurring TKI, genistein, and resveratrol, a non-peroxide, stilbene derivative. The test read-out was the Annexin V apoptosis assay kit from Becton-Dickinson, which detects the presence of the Annexin V protein on the surface of cells undergoing apoptosis and positivity toward propidium iodide for dead cells. In the results presented, the values correspond to the percentage of dead cells (dead + apoptotic) and the baseline values for the vehicle controls are 13-18 %. Synergy is expressed as moderate* or high**. MCF-7 MDA-468 Imatinib 10 µM 14.05 % 13.60 % Trioxane T7, 1 µM 13.10 % 15.17 % Imatinib 10 µM + 17.00 % 48.27 %** Trioxane T7, 1 µM Imatinib 10 µM 14.15 % 13.16 % Trioxane T59, 1 µM 19.00 % 13.70 % Imatinib 10 µM + 27.10 % * 48.50 %** Trioxane T59 1 µM Genistein, 10 µM 17.50 % 18.50 % Trioxane T7, 1 µM 13.10 % 15.20 % Genistein, 10 µM + 15.40 % 48.10 %** Trioxane T7, 1 µM Genistein, 10 µM 17.50 % 18.50 % Resveratrol, 1 µM 16.05 % 11.30 % Genistein, 10 µM + 17.50 % 18.50 % resveratrol, 1 µM These results show that the trioxanes T7 and T59 synergize well with imatinib when added to MDA cell cultures, but minimally when added to MCF-7 cultures (save for a moderate synergy between imatinib and trioxane T59). The naturally occurring TKI, genistein (an isoflavone extracted from soybeans), shows no synergy, either with trioxane T7 or resveratrol in MCF-7 cells. However, trioxane T7 synergizes well with genistein in MDA cells, whereas genistein and resveratrol synergize neither in MCF-7 nor in MDA cells, emphasizing the superior"

In chronic myeloid leukemia, STAT5 activation also participates in the development of MPNs. 100 In addition, resistance to imatinib may be mediated by an increased expression of STAT5. 201 Recent evidence has suggested that the development of MPNs is independent of JAK2 and that activation of STAT5 is directly mediated by BCR-ABL. 202 In AML, it has been suggested that SRC kinases promote STAT phosphorylation and survival. 203 Genes"

A review of the FAERS database and the medical literature (for the time period between February 2006 and August 2015) identified three new potential safety issues: drug interaction between dronabinol and imatinib, anaphylaxis, and severe or chronic nausea/vomiting. There were two FAERS cases that reported significantly decreased imatinib levels when dronabinol was co-administered with imatinib. Regarding systemic hypersensitivity reactions, there was one case of positive rechallenge that met the Sampson clinical diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis. Finally, there were 9 cases of nausea, vomiting, or both in this review that used dronabinol for reasons other than cancer chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). In these nine"

Deletion of both Fos and Dusp1, when combined with a 5-week course of imatinib treatment, eradicated all leukemic cells from peripheral blood and bone marrow, and discontinuation of treatment did not result in disease relapse, as assessed by YFP+ cell burden in blood and bone marrow at the end of the experiment, 4 months after tumor cell transplantation ( FIG. 11J ,K). Thus, genetic deletion of Fos and Dusp1 sensitizes BCR-ABL-expressing cells (but not WT cells) to imatinib treatment and eliminates TKI-resistant MRD. Moreover, the deletion of Fos and Dusp1 in ROSACreERT2Fosfl/fl;Dusp1−/− mice by tamoxifen injection did not show any apparent hematopoietic defects, and c-Fos- and Dusp1-deficient cells were maintained in the peripheral blood and bone marrow ( FIG. 12F ), which supports the concept that these genes"

First-Line Treatment Selection Optimizing first-line treatment is essential to achieving better long-term outcomes [ 69 ]. Therapy should be tailored to ensure patients achieve a deep, early response associated with improved long-term survival. More patients achieve a deeper, faster response in the first-line setting with second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors compared with imatinib [ 23 , 24 ]. Long-term follow-up is needed to determine if this correlates with a survival benefit and an improvement in PFS. Once generic imatinib is available, one possibility to reduce treatment cost may be identifying subgroups of patients who have poorer outcomes on imatinib who might derive greater benefit using dasatinib or nilotinib as first-line treatments. Final Considerations In both second- and first-line settings, choosing between dasatinib and nilotinib requires consideration on a patient-to-patient basis, as there is no comparative clinical trial evidence to direct this decision. Economic considerations are anticipated to become a significant factor for treatment selection when generic imatinib becomes available in 2015. A prospective early change trial would help define a population of patients with equivalent response and survival when continuing on imatinib treatment compared with changing to a second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitor. For the remaining patients, this trial would present definitive evidence for the required level and timing of response, indicating a need to change from imatinib to a more potent BCR-ABL inhibitor and thus providing the best possibility of achieving improved long-term outcomes. \n                               \n                                "

Restriction analysis of 30 plasmid clones each showed 15 and 6% frequency of mutant amplicon copies derived from clones 4 and 10, respectively. Discussion The cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the development of STI571-resistance in vitro and in vivo involves both quantitative and qualitative changes of the Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase. Here, we report development of STI571 resistance in p210 Bcr/Abl -positive myeloid cell line KBM5-STI571 R1.0 growing in the continuous presence of STI571; the acquisition of the resistant phenotype was characterized by only a marginal increase in the number of BCR/ABL gene copies and the level of expression of Bcr/Abl protein. The resistant cells display, however, a Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase that is resistant to STI571 inhibition. The uniqueness of the resistant cells lies in the presence of a specific mutation within the ATP-binding domain of Bcr/Abl. Whereas such mutation has recently been found by Gore et al. (4) in patients with a STI571-resistant blastic phase of CML, this is the first report of mutation in the ATP-binding pocket of the Abl kinase domain, which has been found in BCR/ABL -positive cell line rendered resistant to STI571 exposure in vitro . When studied in patients, the mutation was detected in 17–80% of RT-PCR-derived BCR/ABL plasmid clones (4) . The presence of both mutated and wild-type BCR/ABL transcripts was postulated to reflect mutant and wild-type BCR/ABL patients’ cells (4 , 7) . Possible different proportions of mutant and"

We report two cases of gastrointestinal stromal tumor identified on prostatic biopsies, where a primary prostatic sarcoma was considered in the differential diagnosis. In one of the cases, there was extensive local disease involving prostate, rectum, and pelvic wall, as well as metastatic disease that quickly lead to the patient's death despite aggressive treatment with imatinib mesylate and conventional chemotherapy.

By following the fate of mass isotopomers using 13 C‐1,2 glucose, it is possible to discriminate between the oxidative and nonoxidative branches of the pentose phosphate pathway, while also monitoring flux through glycolysis and in the citric acid cycle. Thus, chronic myeloid leukemia cells expressing the Bcr‐Abl tyrosine kinase treated with the inhibitor imatinib showed a diminished incorporation of label into RNA ribose, specifically pointing to a reduction in the oxidative branch of the PPP, This was associated with a substantial decrease in G6PDH activity, the entry enzyme for the oxidative branch of the PPP, but little effect on the TA/TK enzymes in the"

In an early report of patients treated for Ph + CML, imatinib was associated with the development of severe heart failure, 67 prompting the manufacturer to revise the drug labeling to include warnings about possible heart failure. Laboratory studies indicate that adverse cardiac events in patients receiving imatinib are likely mediated by the inhibition of ABL. 67,68 Despite the biologic rationale for potential CTX in patients receiving imatinib, subsequent publications indicate a low incidence of clinically significant heart failure in CML clinical trial settings (no more than 1%-2% 69 ); and an increased risk for heart failure or LV dysfunction has not been observed in patients receiving imatinib for the treatment of GIST. 70–72 However, obtaining a baseline assessment of LVEF in all patients receiving imatinib (particularly for GIST where it is not even clear that there is a risk of CTX) is not supported by compelling data. Nonetheless, patients receiving imatinib should be monitored for signs and symptoms of heart failure, and physicians should have a low threshold for the formal assessment of LV dysfunction. Guidelines for the management of imatinib toxicity from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network suggest that only patients with cardiac disease or risk factors for heart failure who are receiving imatinib need to be monitored carefully and that any patient with signs or symptoms consistent with heart failure should be evaluated and treated. 73 Dasatinib and nilotinib Dasatinib and nilotinib are two second-generation multitargeted TKIs that are used for the treatment of Ph + CML.

Loss of Abl Kinase Function Decreased Endothelial Barrier Dysfunction In Vitro We examined whether the Abl kinases may play a role in the induction of endothelial permeability in vitro , by assessing the passage of fluorescein-labeled dextran through HMVEC monolayers following pharmacological inhibition of the Abl kinases. Consistent with previous reports [ 28 , 35 ], Abl kinase inhibition with imatinib greatly decreased endothelial barrier dysfunction induced by VEGF ( Figures 2A-B ). Imatinib also inhibited permeability induced by thrombin and histamine ( Figure 2B ). As imatinib also inhibits kinases other than Abl and Arg, including the receptors CSF1R (also known as c-Fms), PDGFR, Kit, and the discoidin domain receptors [ 27 , 36 , 37 ], we examined the effects of the allosteric Abl kinase inhibitor GNF-2 on endothelial permeability. GNF-2, which binds to the myristate-binding pocket in the kinase domain of Abl and Arg, displays greater target specificity than imatinib and is not known to inhibit any additional kinases [ 38 , 39 ]. Importantly, the Abl/Arg-specific inhibitor GNF-2 also decreased endothelial permeability induced by VEGF, thrombin, or histamine ( Figure 2B ), suggesting that the preservation of endothelial barrier function upon imatinib treatment likely results from inhibition of the Abl family kinases.

Not surprisingly, a greater percentage of imatinib-intolerant (31%) than imatinib-resistant (17%) patients discontinued therapy because of AEs, most commonly thrombocytopenia in both groups. Nonetheless, a discontinuation rate of 31% in patients with previous intolerance to imatinib provides indirect evidence of limited cross-intolerance to bosutinib. In conclusion, these data suggest bosutinib is effective, with an acceptable safety profile that is differentiated from that of other TKIs, and may offer a new treatment option for patients with CP CML who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Results of this study support continued investigation of bosutinib for the treatment of Ph + CML. Clinical evaluations of bosutinib in the settings of newly diagnosed CP CML, CP CML after failure of 2 or more TKIs, and accelerated phase and blast phase CML are currently ongoing. 38 Acknowledgments The"

Overall, PCyR was observed in 14% of patients and CCyR in 40%. Responses were durable, with 88% of patients with MCyR sustaining their response for at least 2 years. Given the availability of second-generation TKIs that have shown significant efficacy also in this setting, it is important to put our results in perspective with the available data with dasatinib and nilotinib after imatinib failure. At 24 months, dasatinib induced in patients with imatinib failure MCyR and CCyR rates of 55% and 45%, respectively. 11 With a follow-up of 24 months, 75% of patients treated with dasatinib for imatinib resistance remained progression-free. 11 At 18 months of therapy, nilotinib induced MCyR and CCyR rates of 55% and 41%, respectively, 10 with 64% of the patients treated remaining progression-free. 10 Contrary to what has been previously suggested, 20 , 21 responses to dose escalation were sustained with 88% of patients who achieved a MCyR, maintaining their response beyond 24 months of therapy. The 2-year survival in our series was 84% (81% if patients with PCyR at the time of dose escalation are excluded from the analysis), whereas the 2-year survival with dasatinib after imatinib failure was reported at 92%, and 91% (at 18 months) with nilotinib. 10 , 29 It is important however to consider that comparisons between independent studies performed at different times may not be accurate. In addition, most patients reported in the studies with second-generation TKIs had already failed imatinib dose escalation. It is also important to underscore that the definitions proposed for failure were created for patients receiving imatinib as initial therapy, and it is unclear whether they apply equally to patients who receive imatinib after failing other therapies that constitute the majority of patients in our series and those of dasatinib and nilotinib after imatinib failure. Still, our results suggest that dose escalation may be an acceptable strategy for some patients with resistance to standard-dose imatinib. Imatinib dose escalation was particularly effective in patients with cytogenetic failure who had achieved a cytogenetic response with standard-dose imatinib. Among them, the rates of CCyR and MCyR were 73% and 87% for those with 35% or more Ph + metaphases before escalation, respectively, compared with 52% and 60% for the overall group of similar patients with cytogenetic failure. In a recent randomized phase II study, dasatinib improved the cytogenetic and molecular response rates and the progression-free survival compared with imatinib dose escalation. 29 However, in a subset analysis, the difference in favor of dasatinib was considerably smaller among patients who failed standard-dose imatinib and those who had achieved a previous cytogenetic response. In those, the rates of MCyR were 70% and 60%, respectively. 30 In addition, this randomized trial of dasatinib versus imatinib dose escalation had a crossover design that allowed crossover for lack of MCyR at the 3 months evaluation. As we report here, the median time to cytogenetic response after imatinib dose escalation is 9 months. Thus, the early crossover may have prevented full evaluation of the potential benefit of this strategy. Thus, with a longer follow-up and a larger number of patients, our study confirmed the sustained efficacy of imatinib dose escalation in patients with cytogenetic failure. In contrast, these results also show that patients who never achieved a cytogenetic response to standard dose imatinib or those with hematologic failure are highly unlikely to benefit from imatinib dose escalation. In our study, only 25 of 84 patients were tested for BCR-ABL mutation at the time of standard-dose imatinib failure; all 8 patients harboring non-P–loop mutations responded to imatinib dose escalation. There was no difference in response, EFS, and TFS rates between patients with or without mutations. The presence of mutations at the time of standard-dose imatinib failure did not impact the EFS. These needs to be interpreted with caution in view of the lack of some highly resistant mutations (eg, P-loop, T315I) detected in this population. The incidence of BCR-ABL KD mutations at the time of standard-dose imatinib failure has been reported to be approximately 40% to 60%, 31 – 33 with several mutations within the ABL structure in BCR-ABL conferring relative rather than absolute resistance to standard-dose imatinib. 16 Non P-loop mutations retain relative sensitivity to imatinib, 34 which may explain the response to dose escalation seen in this small cohort of patients. Second-generation TKIs have shown activity against all kinds of mutations except for the notable T315I mutation. 10 – 12 In the randomized study, dasatinib was particularly superior to high-dose imatinib in patients harboring BCR-ABL KD mutations associated with more than 5-fold increase in imatinib resistance (such as the P-loop mutations), where the CHR and major cytogenetic response rates were 84% and 48% versus 29% and 14%, respectively. 29 This is supported by our limited experience that shows imatinib dose escalation to be effective in patients harboring no or, relatively, sensitive BCR-ABL KD mutations. High-dose imatinib was generally well tolerated in this study, with a third of the patients having their dose reduced, mostly for myelosuppression. The rate of myelosuppresion was still lower than the rates observed with the second-generation TKIs. 10 , 11 After 12 months of therapy, 76% of patients continued to receive 100% of the intended daily dose. Thus, higher imatinib dosages could be delivered to most patients after failure of imatinib standard dose. These data suggest that imatinib dose escalation is well tolerated and may be effective in overcoming resistance to standard-dose imatinib, inducing long-lasting cytogenetic responses in some patients with imatinib resistance, particularly those with cytogenetic relapse and less disease burden. However, these results have to be taken in the context of other available therapies, including second-generation TKIs and stem cell transplantation.

Back in the late nineties, following the approvals of Gleevec and Herceptin, it all seemed so different. Personalized medicine was the powerful idea that would drive rational use of pharmaceutical products.

The Stanford researchers found that the antibody reduces the amount of KIT on the surface of the cancer cells and stimulates immune cells called macrophages to kill the rogue cells . Currently, people with GIST are often treated first with surgery and then with the drug imatinib, marketed as Gleevec - a small molecule that also targets KIT. The treatment, which was approved for GIST in 2002, has been remarkably successful: It has increased the average survival time of many people with advanced disease from about 18 months to about five years. It was the first targeted small molecule inhibitor that proved effective against a solid tumor, but its effect is temporary. \" Gleevec , or imatinib, marked a paradigm shift in our understanding about cancer treatment and sparked much additional research into these inhibitors,\" said Matt van de Rijn, MD, PhD, professor of pathology. \"However, a new mutation almost always occurs over time in KIT that renders the tumor insensitive to the drug.

Imatinib mesylate (1 μM, 10 μM) or DMSO (control) was added to 40% confluent H1703 cells, 24 hours later both adhering cells and floating cells were harvested, and apoptosis was measured by quantifying cleaved caspase-3 by flow cytometry. Results from the mean of 3 independent experiments are shown (error bars indicate standard deviations). FIG. 9D is Western blots showing that Imatinib induces cleaved PARP expression in H1703 cells.

Drug delivery systems are evaluated in 3 pigs to ensure that the systemic level of drugs is acceptable: initially, the drug delivery will not exceed 50 ng/ml for Gleevec and 0.1 ng/ml for rapamycin. Drug serum levels are measured for each of the delivery systems at day 4, 7, and 14 after implantation. Approximately 95% confidence limits for the mean level at each time point are determined. If the upper confidence limit is below the cutoff, we will assume that the systemic level of drug is acceptable and proceed with the experiments outlined below. If the systemic levels of drugs are lower than 50 ng/ml for Gleevec and 0.1 ng/ml for rapamycin, we can assume—based on in vitro data on effects on VSMCs—that these systemic levels will not effect grafts on the other side of the pig. This will allow us to evaluate two grafts per pig, each graft having different drugs incorporated for local delivery. Thus, we can assess two of the four treatments (Gleevec; rapamycin; combination; or delivery device only) within one animal. If systemic levels are higher than those indicated on any of these days, then the same drug/polymer is tested bilaterally in each of 4 groups of pigs i.e. each pig having two identical drug polymers.

In a separate case study in the same issue, four cases reporting the activity of Glivec in treating certain life-threatening blood diseases suggest the drug may offer a potential treatment for these conditions.         \"These impressive positive results in GIST, a form of sarcoma which is highly resistant to any conventional chemotherapy, are very exciting news for these patients, who had essentially no effective treatment options before Glivec,\" said George D. Demetri, MD, Director of the Center for Sarcoma and Bone Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. \"These data support the observations that the anticancer responses with Glivec in GIST patients are often durable. It is clear that this treatment can shrink even massive tumors in the majority of patients with this malignancy, by targeting and inhibiting the mutant enzyme which is abnormally active in this tumor type.\" Study Details: GIST         The GIST study was a Phase II, open-label, randomized, international, multicentre trial that evaluated treatment with Glivec in 147 patients. The GIST patients were randomly assigned to receive either 400 mg (N=73) or 600 mg (N=74) of Glivec once daily. All patients in this study had advanced disease and most had failed other treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.         In the NEJM report, responses remained durable for more than 46 weeks, and a median duration of response had not yet been reached. The estimated one-year survival rate is 88%. To date, the median survival rate has not been established. *  In the US: Gleevec (imatinib mesylate) 16         The NEJM results provide updated data to those originally submitted to the European Union, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other global regulatory authorities in 2001 for approval of Glivec in the treatment of Kit positive unresectable and/or metastatic GISTs. Specifically, these approvals were based on data showing a response rate of 38% after a median follow-up of approximately seven months. At a median follow-up of nine months, as reported in the NEJM, the confirmed rate of objective responses rose"

Differences in imatinib pharmacokinetics among individuals might be influenced by genetic polymorphisms and be associated with variable clinical imatinib efficacy. This study sought to test how genetic polymorphisms can affect the clinical efficacy of imatinib and its blood levels in GIST patients. A total of 209 GIST patients who had received imatinib 400 mg daily were genotyped for six single-nucleotide polymorphisms in three genes (CYP3A5 6986A\u003eG; ABCB1 1236C\u003eT, 2677G\u003eA/T, and 3435C\u003eT; and ABCG2 34G\u003eA and 421C\u003eA) via blood samples. Progression-free survival (PFS) and imatinib plasma trough levels were evaluated and compared according to genotypes. With a median follow-up of 39.6 months (range 16.7-97.5 months), the estimated 5-year PFS rate was 67.5 % (95 % CI 59.9-75.1). Among the CYP3A5, ABCB1, and ABCG2 genotypes, ABCG2 421C\u003eA was associated with PFS. The 5-year PFS rate in patients with the AA variant of ABCG2 421C\u003eA (92.3 %; 95 % CI 77.8-100.0) was significantly superior to that of patients with CC/CA genotypes (65.0 %; 95 % CI 56.9-73.1; p = 0.047). For the imatinib trough levels, there were no statistically significant differences when comparing polymorphisms among all genotypes, even after adjusting for clinical factors, including sex, age, body surface area, hemoglobin, albumin, and creatinine clearance. The ABCG2 421C\u003eA genetic variation could influence clinical efficacy in terms of PFS in patients with advanced GIST undergoing imatinib therapy. \n                               \n                                                                "

The advanced phases (AP and BC) are associated with disease progression and a much poorer prognosis. Most people (approximately 90%) are diagnosed during the CP.

According to the International Randomized Study of Interferon and STI571 (IRIS) study, patients randomized to receive imatinib demonstrated an 85% overall survival (OS) rate (8 year data) and 0.9%, 0.5%, 0%, 0%, and 0.4% annual rates of progression to AP or BC in years 4 to 8, respectively, after imatinib therapy onset.

Regulation of mammalian SPT has also been reported to result from phosphorylation of Tyr-164 of hLCB1 ( 9 ). This phosphorylation reduces SPT activity and can be blocked by inhibiting (with imatinib mesylate) or silencing the c-abl kinase in CML cells. Thus, like SPT regulation in yeast, SPT regulation in mammalian cells is complex. However, the specific mechanisms are clearly different. In the present study, we have employed a different approach to study ORMDL regulation of sphingolipid synthesis. Using a stable HEK293 cell"

Incubation with either Shh-K562-Exo or Exo-fraction derived from CML-variant or non-compliant patients (V-CML) (but not Shh-K562-Free, K562-Exo/Free-fractions) could impart similar protection to K562 cells, as seen for Shh-K562 cells (Fig. 6D, E ). Exo-fraction from CML-CP patients demonstrates viability similar to K562 (gray bars, Fig. 6E ). Our results here demonstrate the role of exovesicular-Shh derived from Shh-K562, CML-variants, or non-compliant patients’ BM plasma in imparting Imatinib resistance. It also indicates that the concentration of Shh in CML-variants or non-compliant patients’ plasma is higher compared to CML-CP patients. Sublethal levels of Shh inhibitor or Bcl2 inhibitor can be used as adjuvants to re-sensitize leukemic cells to Imatinib We then evaluate if Cyclopamine or Bcl2 inhibitor (YC137) can be used to overcome Imatinib resistance. For this, K562 cells were treated with BM plasma-derived Exo or free-fractions from CML-variants, non-compliant (V-CML, red bars, Fig. 7 A), or CML-CP patients (gray bars, Fig. 7 A) for 12 h. These pretreated cells were then treated with, Imatinib + Cyclopamine, Imatinib + YC137, or single agents (Imatinib, Cyclopamine, or YC137) for 72 h (Fig. 7 A and Supplementary Fig. 9C). K562 (black bars, Fig. 7 A) and Shh-K562 (green bars, Fig. 7 A) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Imatinib resistance imparted by Exo-fraction (red bars, Fig. 7 A(i)) can be circumvented by using sublethal doses of Cyclopamine or Bcl2 inhibitor in combination with Imatinib (red bars, Fig. 7 A(ii), (iv)). When used as single agents, these inhibitors are not effective (red bars, Fig. 7 A(iii), (v)). They also do not show any significant toxicity on K562 cells (black bars, Fig. 7 A(iii), (v)).

B Cartoon representing mechanism of secretion of different extracellular forms of Shh and Shh-mediated Imatinib resistance in leukemic cells. Available FDA-approved drugs indicated in red text, which can be used to overcome Shh-mediated therapy resistance. Full size image In CML11, Shh is predominantly secreted in free-fraction (~40–50 times higher than the Exo-fraction; compare Fig. 6C and Supplementary Fig. 9B ). Though Shh levels are significantly higher in free-fraction from CML11 patient, it provides similar Imatinib resistance that can also be resolved using Bcl2 or Cyclopamine as adjuvants with Imatinib (Supplementary Fig. 9B, C ). We also noticed that CML11 patient plasma contains a much higher total protein than other CML patients (Supplementary Fig. 10 ). The reason for this observed difference in the extracellular form of Shh or total protein content remains unknown. Our results suggest that Shh is predominantly secreted on exovesicles in CML patients’ BM plasma to impart Imatinib resistance. Shh-mediated resistance to Imatinib is conferred, via the upregulation of the Bcl2 rather than via stemness (Fig. 7B ). In CML-variants and non-compliant patients, Shh signaling can play a major role in contributing toward the poor outcome via Bcl2 upregulation. Expression of Shh and/or Bcl2 can be used as markers to identify non-compliant patients and CML-variants who are likely to demonstrate this mutation-independent Imatinib resistance. We envisage that identifying such patients and treating them with the proposed combinatorial therapy might help in further improving outcomes in CML. However, given the smaller sample size in our study here, this proposition needs to be further clinically tested in larger cohort(s) to evaluate the magnitude of its clinical implication. Discussion The discovery of Imatinib has made a significant difference in the outcome of CML patients. Imatinib is used for almost a decade in India as a frontline monotherapeutic agent. It can maintain 80–90% of patients in the most responsive, CP for a long time. However, 10–20% of patients develop the more aggressive disease. In the current therapeutic regime, CML patients need to take the therapy for a long time (~8–10 years) to achieve deep molecular remission. This need has created additional challenges of non-compliance and drug toxicity. Often, Imatinib toxicity develops after 2 years of treatment 26 . We find that CML-variants (in CP), despite the different additional chromosomal involvement (Supplementary Table 1 ), demonstrate upregulation in Shh expression and signaling compared to CML-CP patients. A non-compliant patient also demonstrates significant upregulation in Shh expression. This can be detected"

In BCR-ABL1 T315I , the extra hydrocarbon group in the isoleucine side chain results in steric clash with imatinib and dasatinib, which interferes with binding of these compounds but not of adenosine 5'-triphosphate. 1 In this manner, BCR-ABL1 T315I confers virtually complete insensitivity to imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib. 7 The importance of the early detection of BCR-ABL1 T315I is severalfold. First, it has been recently reported that sequential BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitor therapy with imatinib and dasatinib may select with high frequency for BCR-ABL1 T315I as well as for other resistant compound mutants (two or more BCR-ABL1 KD mutations in the same clone) with altered oncogenic potency. 8 Second, several other screening assays with significantly higher sensitivity than DS, in addition to DESC, have been"

The mechanism of inhibition is through competitive inhibition of ATP binding. To better understand the mechanism of specificity of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor the Abl kinase was compared to a model of the Lck kinase domain. This model predicts the following sites are critical for STI571 association: L248, Y320, N322, E373, H375 and A380. Each of these residues were changed to the corresponding residue in Src or fms and IC 50 values for STI571 with each mutant were determined. L248A and H375L yielded kinase inactive mutants, Y320K, N322S, E373N and A380G had IC 50 values identical to wild type Abl. A380T, however, demonstrated an IC 50 of 0.34 μM suggesting that STI571 bound less efficiently when a larger residue replaced the alanine. Recent crystallization of the Abl kinase domain with a related inhibitor shows that the configuration of the activation loop of the Abl kinase domain differs significantly from that of the Src family kinases. This structure identifies K271, E286, M290, T315, M318 and D381 as critical contacts of STI571. All of these residues are conserved between Src and Abl. The last two of these bind STI571 via their peptide backbone, thus mutants in these residues cannot be created. The remainder of the residues were mutated to residues lacking the potential for hydrogen bonding and IC 50 values were determined. K271R, E286L and M290A were kinase inactive. T315V had an IC 50 value of 0.35 μM, which is consistent with the crystal structure of the Abl kinase domain which predicts that the side chain of T315 forms a critical hydrogen bond with STI571. Example 3 A group of 32 patients who are either refractory to treatment with STI571 or who relapsed whilst being treated were investigated. The median duration of therapy was 95 days; prior to STI571 treatment, two patients were in chronic phase, nine in accelerated phase, 20 in myeloid and, and one in lymphoid blast crisis of the disease. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) products specific for the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase domain were sequenced (Heminested RT-PCR was performed to amplify the sequence specifically coding for"

In patients not responding to 400 or 600 mg, dose escalation to 800 mg is warranted with caution, but dose escalation beyond this is not advised. Is flat dosing with 400 and 600 mg appropriate, regardless of patient size? From population-based pharmacokinetic studies, there is no evidence that the size of the patient has an impact on the plasma levels of STI571. 9 In our institution, we have treated 17 chronic phase patients weighing over 250 pounds (113 kg) who had failed prior therapy with IFN. Fifteen of these 17 patients (88%) achieved a CHR and 10/17 (58%) achieved a major cytogenetic response. Although based on only a small number of patients, these response rates are similar to those seen in phase II studies. Thus, our experience confirms the pharmacokinetic data that flat dosing is appropriate. Practical Dose Considerations and Dose Modifications for Myelosuppression Dose and hematologic monitoring In CML patients in chronic phase, the recommended starting dose of STI571 is 400 mg. CBCs should be monitored weekly for the first month. Thereafter, the frequency of blood count monitoring depends on the stability and the level of the blood count. Thus, if a patient's ANC falls to less than 1500/mm 3 and/or the platelet count to less than 100,000/mm 3"

Abstract: The majority of kinase inhibitors that have been developed so far--known as type I inhibitors--target the ATP binding site of the kinase in its active conformation, in which the activation loop is phosphorylated. Recently, crystal structures of inhibitors such as imatinib (STI571), BIRB796 and sorafenib (BAY43-9006)--known as type II inhibitors--have revealed a new binding mode that exploits an additional binding site immediately adjacent to the region occupied by ATP. This pocket is made accessible by an activation-loop rearrangement that is characteristic of kinases in an inactive conformation. Here, we present a structural"

Imatinib mesylate (IM) is the first line of therapy for treatment of CML and results in remission in most cases. However, a significant percentage of patients develop chemoresistance to IM, which might be due to the presence of chemoresistant cells in the bone marrow. In the current study, we explored the role"

Indeed, our data show that both RIP1 as well as p38 were activated upon Bcr-Abl hyper-activation. Inhibition of RIP1 by Necrostatin-1 partially rescued cells from imatinib deprivation-induced cell death, indicating that this necrotic/necroptotic signaling pathway substitutes for the blocked apoptosis at least partially.

Accordingly, the prescription instructions for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors often suggest caution regarding the potential of occurrence of drug interactions with substrates, inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A compounds ( Walker, 1989 ). We therefore hypothesised that coadministration of imatinib, as an inhibitor of the microsomal CYP3A4 enzyme system, could affect the elimination rate of simvastatin. The present study was undertaken to assess this potential pharmacokinetic interaction by evaluation of the simvastatin plasma concentration vs time profiles after coadministration with imatinib ( US Department of Health and Human Services, 1999 ) and its effects on safety and tolerability in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML).

MST1 kinase activity was monitored by an in vitro kinase assay using Histone H2B or the FD of FOXO3 as the substrate. We demostrate that c-Abl is capable of enhancing kinase activity of WT-MST1 but not MST1-Y433F ( Fig. 6 A , B ). Similarly, inhibition of c-Abl kinase activity by STI571 resulted in a decreased phosphorylation of FOXO3 at Ser 207, corresponding to the reduced phosphorylation of MST1 at Y433 ( Fig. 6 C ). We previously reported that FOXO3 binds to MST1 through the Forkhead domain of FOXO3 ( Lehtinen et al., 2006 ), and here we demonstrate further that the C terminus of MST1 is essential for this association, even though there is a stronger interaction between FOXO3 and full-length MST1 (data not shown). Since we found that both STI571 treatment of neurons and knockdown of endogenous c-Abl in Neuro2A cells greatly reduced hydrogen peroxide-induced interaction between MST1 and FOXO3 ( Fig. 6 D , E ), we next asked whether Y433 phosphorylation in the C-terminal region of MST1 enhanced the interaction between MST1 and FOXO3.

When compared with patients whose tumors harbor exon 11 mutants, presence of exon 9 mutations and wild-type GIST were the strongest adverse prognostic factor for objective response, risk of progression and death. 33 Having identified a “high-risk” cohort of patients, investigators next questioned if imatinib dose-escalation could overcome this adverse prognostic feature. In the meta-analysis of the two large phase III imatinib dose-efficacy studies undertaken by Van Glabbeke and colleagues, a statistically significantly progression-free survival benefit in patients who received imatinib 800 mg/day was demonstrated in the subset of patients with KIT exon 9 mutations from EORTC dataset. This finding was not confirmed in the North American dataset.

Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, STI571), a selective Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown activity in all CML phases (blastic, accelerated, chronic after failure of IFN-α). 14-20 Herein, we summarize our results, previously reported in abstract form, 21 in patients with newly diagnosed CML treated with imatinib mesylate 400 mg orally daily, demonstrating high early rates of major and complete cytogenetic responses. Study design Study group Patients with Ph + CML in early chronic phase (diagnosis to therapy \u003c 12 months) were treated; informed consent was obtained according to institutional guidelines. Eligibility criteria were age 15 years or older; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2; adequate renal (creatinine less than twice upper limit of normal), hepatic (bilirubin less than twice upper limit of normal), and cardiac functions (New York Heart Association cardiac disease grade 3-4 excluded); no prior imatinib mesylate therapy; and no more than 1 month of IFN-α therapy. Women of childbearing potential were required to have a negative pregnancy test before starting imatinib mesylate; all patients at risk were required to use barrier contraception while on therapy. Chronic-phase CML was defined as less than 15% blasts, less than 20% basophils, and less than 30% blasts plus promyelocytes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, and platelet counts of 100 × 10 9 /L or higher. Therapy and monitoring Patients received imatinib mesylate 400 mg orally daily. Patient monitoring and dose reductions of imatinib mesylate for nonhematologic or hematologic toxicities were detailed previously. 18 When possible, patients were not reduced below a minimal daily dose of 300 mg daily. If therapy at this dose resulted in severe myelosuppression (not manageable with growth factors, eg, epoetin alfa [Procrit], granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]), the treatment was interrupted"

Furthermore, since no deleted cells were observed in a CD16− purified fraction of eosinophils in one F/P -positive patient before imatinib therapy (data not shown), we may suggest in this patient a F/P clonality restricted to low-density cells retained in the mononuclear cell layer (CMN) after density gradient separation, but further investigations of the CMN and CD16+/CD16− fractions in other HES patients should be performed to confirm this hypothesis.

                    "whole genome sequencing. \n Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a very rare soft tissue sarcoma. DFSP often reveals a specific chromosome translocation, t(17;22)(q22;q13), which results in the fusion of collagen 1 alpha 1 (COL1A1) gene and platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGFB) gene. The COL1A1-PDGFB fusion protein activates the PDGFB receptor and resultant constitutive activation of PDGFR receptor is essential in the pathogenesis of DFSP. Thus, blocking PDGFR receptor activation with imatinib has shown promising activity in the treatment of advanced and metastatic DFSP. Despite the success with targeted agents in cancers, acquired drug resistance eventually occurs. Here, we tried to identify potential drug resistance mechanisms against imatinib in a 46-year old female with DFSP who initially responded well to imatinib but suffered rapid disease progression. We performed whole-genome sequencing of both pre-treatment and post-treatment tumor tissue to identify the mutational events associated with imatinib resistance. No significant copy number alterations, insertion, and deletions were identified during imatinib treatment. Of note, we identified newly emerged 8 non-synonymous somatic mutations of the genes (ACAP2, CARD10, KIAA0556, PAAQR7, PPP1R39, SAFB2, STARD9, and ZFYVE9) in the imatinib-resistant tumor tissue. This study revealed diverse possible candidate mechanisms by which imatinib resistance to PDGFRB inhibition may arise in DFSP, and highlights the usefulness of whole-genome sequencing in identifying drug resistance mechanisms and in pursuing genome-directed, personalized anti-cancer therapy. \n                               \n            "

To that end, we performed saturation mutagenesis studies in cells to examine the emergence of new mutations in KIT following exposure to DCC-2618 or imatinib. The results demonstrate that, while new drug resistance mutations are produced rapidly in response to imatinib exposure (four new mutations secondary to exposure were recorded), we observed no gain-of-function mutations resistant to DCC-2618. These results further support the pan-KIT inhibitor profile of DCC-2618 and its potential resilience to the emergence of mutations resistant to kinase switch control inhibition.

However, in K562 cells overexpressing CIP2A (by transfection of pCMV6–CIP2A–GFP plasmid), imatinib treatment did not alter proliferation, whereas dasatinib and nilotinib both reduced proliferation ( P =0.03 and P =0.03, respectively, ). This again demonstrates a differential effect on CIP2A between imatinib vs 2G TKI. The early identification of CML patients likely to progress and die from BC is important. CIP2A has previously been identified as a biomarker which identifies those patients likely to progress into BC, if treated with imatinib. Here, we extend these observations, showing that patients with a high diagnostic CIP2A level and treated with a 2G TKI do not progress to BC, unlike those treated with imatinib. The survival and molecular outcomes of those patients with a high CIP2A level at diagnosis and treated with a 2G TKI are similar to those with a low CIP2A diagnostic level, although high CIP2A patients treated with a 2G TKI have an inferior MR4 rate than low CIP2A patients, suggesting that high CIP2A in 2G TKI-treated patients is a marker for poor molecular response. Both dasatinib and nilotinib significantly decrease CIP2A levels in primary CML cells, and this is associated with a decrease in both c-Myc and BCR–ABL tyrosine kinase activity, and reactivation of PP2A. Imatinib did reduce the BCR–ABL tyrosine kinase activity, it did not affect CIP2A levels nor did it significantly reactivate PP2A. The present data are consistent with a positive feedback loop within the CIP2A/c-Myc/E2F1 pathway ( ). E2F1 is significantly higher in patients with a high diagnostic CIP2A level; this is a"

Gcr1p itself is regulated by phosphorylation, and a negative regulation of its activity might partially account for the indications of decreased glycolysis that were obtained in this study.

Interestingly, none of these 8 proteins were identified as being differentially expressed in response to imatinib.

Given previous evidence that certain susceptibility loci and carcinogens are associated with characteristic mutations, or “signatures” in other cancers, we hypothesized that the characteristic somatic mutations in the KIT and PDGFRA genes in GIST tumors may similarly be mutational signatures that are causally linked to specific mutagens or susceptibility loci."

Biochemical abnormalities Rates of biochemical abnormalities vary in patients receiving different BCR-ABL inhibitors and seem to be most common during nilotinib treatment. In the DASISION trial, grade 3-4 hypophosphatemia occurred in 4% of patients treated with dasatinib compared with 21% of the patients treated with imatinib. Rates of other grade 3-4 biochemical abnormalities were low in both treatment arms, including markers of hepatic toxicity (elevated alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] each \u003c 1% vs 1%, elevated total bilirubin 1% vs 0%) and pancreatic toxicity (no grade 3/4 elevations in lipase or amylase, or cases"

The position and amino acid number of the 9Y/F and the 3Y/F substitutions are indicated in the scheme according to the ABL-1a amino acid numbering. B : The kinase-defective BCR 63 -ABL 9Y/F-KD construct was transfected into COS cells and the localization of the protein determined by immunofluorescence. Nuclear localization of the kinase-defective protein was only observed in cells treated with 10 µM imatinib and 10 nM LMB, as indicated by the white arrows. C : The gatekeeper mutation (T315I), which prevents imatinib from binding to the ATP binding pocket of BCR-ABL, was introduced into the BCR 63 -ABL 9Y/F-KD backbone to test whether imatinib enables the nuclear import of the kinase-defective protein through direct binding to its kinase domain. The respective construct (BCR 63 -ABL 9Y/F-KD-T315I ) was transfected into COS cells and the subcellular localization of the ectopically expressed protein examined by immunofluorescence. No nuclear localization of the protein was detected in the absence or presence of imatinib and LMB. D : The BCR 63 -ABL 3Y/F-KD protein, in which the three tyrosines Y232, Y253, and Y257 are mutated to phenylalanines, was expressed in COS cells. The subcellular localization was again determined by immunofluorescence in untreated cells, as well as after the treatment with imatinib and LMB. Dashed arrows indicate minimal nuclear staining in the absence of imatinib, white arrows point to cells showing predominately nuclear localization in the presence of imatinib. To identify which of the nine Y/F mutations was responsible for the inhibition of nuclear import, we systematically reverted the nine phenylalanines back to tyrosines. We found that reversion of three phenylalanines at positions 232 (SPN Y 232 D), and 253, 257 (GGGQ Y 253 GEV Y 257 EG) restored nuclear import, i.e., the BCR 63 -ABL 6Y/F-KD protein could accumulate in the nucleus by the treatment with LMB alone without imatinib (supplementary Figure S3 ). Conversely, mutation of tyrosines 232, 253 and 257 to phenylalanines was sufficient to block nuclear import, i.e., the BCR 63 -ABL 3Y/F-KD required the combined treatment with imatinib and LMB to accumulate in the nucleus ( Figure 4D ). Single and double mutants, having either one or two of the three tyrosines mutated to phenylalanines, also showed some nuclear import, indicated by weak nuclear accumulation in LMB-treated cells (supplementary Figure S4 ). We then mutated the three critical tyrosines (Tyr232, 253 or 257) individually to glutamic acid, which mimics phosphorylation, in the BCR 63 -ABL KD context and found that each Y/E substitution alone is sufficient to block the nuclear import of this kinase-defective BCR 63 -ABL KD protein ( Figure 5B ). Again, treatment with imatinib induced nuclear accumulation of the phosphomimetic mutants Y232E and Y257E ( Figure 5B ). However, imatinib did not stimulate the nuclear import of the Y253E mutant ( Figure 5B ), which is consistent with the fact that BCR-ABL Y253H was an imatinib-resistant mutant isolated from drug-resistant CML cells [35] . Open in a separate window Figure 5 Phosphomimetic mutation of either Tyr232, Tyr253, or Tyr257 blocks nuclear import of kinase-defective BCR 63 -ABL. A : Position of tyrosines 232, 253, and 257 as seen in a crystal structure of the ABL kinase domain bound to imatinib ( [31] , PDB code 1IEP). The Tyr253 and Tyr257 are in the P-loop (yellow), and are engaged in interactions with other P-loop side chains (Gln252 and Glu255) in this structure. Tyr232 is located in the SH2-kinase linker region and situated right above the kinase N-lobe in this structure. B : BCR 63 -ABL KD , in which either Tyr232, 253 or 257 was mutated to glutamic acid, was transiently expressed in COS cells. The localization of each of these three Y/E-mutant proteins after the indicated treatments with LMB and imatinib was determined by immunofluorescence. Merged images of BCR-ABL staining (red) and DNA (blue) are shown. Cells displaying nuclear staining are marked by the white arrows. Results shown in Figures 3 , ,4 4 and and5 5 suggest that Tyr232, Tyr253 and Tyr257 play crucial roles in regulating the NLS function.",

Point mutations have been detected in ATP-binding domain of ABL gene which disturbs the binding of Gleevec to this target leading to resistance. Detection of mutations is helpful in clinical management of imatinib resistance. We established a very sensitive (ASO) PCR to detect mutations in an imatinib-resistant CML patient. Mutations C944T and T1052C were detected which cause complete partial imatinib resistance, respectively. This is the first report of multiple point mutations conferring primary imatinib resistance in same patient at the same time. Understanding the biological reasons of primary imatinib resistance is one of the emerging issues of pharmacogenomics and will be helpful in understanding primary resistance of molecularly-targeted cancer therapies. It will also be of great utilization in clinical management of imatinib resistance. Moreover, this ASO-PCR assay is very effective in detecting mutations related to imatinib resistance. \n                               \n                                                                "

Although surgery remains the only potentially curative treatment, patients who undergo complete resection may still experience local recurrence or distant metastases. Therapeutic strategies that combine surgical resection and adjuvant imatinib may represent the best treatment to maximize patient outcomes. In addition to the use of imatinib in the adjuvant and metastatic settings, neoadjuvant imatinib, employed as a cytoreductive therapy, can decrease tumor volume, increase the probability of complete resection, and may reduce surgery-related morbidities. Thus, selected patients with metastatic disease may be treated with a combination of preoperative imatinib and metastasectomy. However, it is critical that patients with GIST be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team to coordinate surgery and targeted therapy in order to maximize clinical outcomes. Discussion Following a systematic literature review, we describe the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of GIST, with a discussion of the risk assessment for imatinib therapy. The application of surgical options, combined with adjuvant/neoadjuvant or perioperative imatinib, and their potential impact on survival for patients with primary, recurrent, or metastatic GIST are discussed. \n Introduction Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common type of mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. The estimated prevalence of GIST is 12–20 cases per million, with an estimated annual incidence of"

Edema-related side effects are relatively common in imatinib therapy with the periocular skin representing one of the most common sites for localized edema. While the adverse effect of periorbital edema with imatinib is well documented in the oncology literature, there is limited reference to this common reaction in the ophthalmology literature. We report two patients with upper eyelid edema associated with imatinib therapy who required surgical intervention to ameliorate significant visual field obstruction. We highlight the details of each case including the histopathologic findings of excised redundant skin followed by a thorough review of the literature on imatinib related periorbital edema. \n Introduction Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec ® ) is a well-established pharmacologic treatment for all phases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). 1 – 3 Mechanisms of action include selective inhibition of several tyrosine kinases, including the bcr-abl fusion protein in CML and the c-kit proto-oncogene in GIST. 2 ,"

It is, however, consistent with the experimental observation that imatinib sensitivity was reduced in BCR-ABL1 -trans- duced murine cells selected for low BCR-ABL1 expression. 26 The median limit of detection of BCR-ABL1 DNA was MR5.2 versus MR4.6 for conventional RQ-PCR.

Once established in distal tissues, viral replication and actin tails may contribute to further expansion of virus, despite the addition of the drug. A similar argument may account for our observation that increasing the inoculum to 2 × 10 5 PFU, or 10 times the LD 100 , overcame the protective benefit of imatinib mesylate (data not shown). Notably, the effects of imatinib mesylate on limiting dissemination were particularly evident at low viral titers (Fig. (Fig.6e), 6e ), akin to the infectious dose for VarV in humans, in luciferase assays. Another factor contributing to the efficacy of imatinib mesylate following inoculation may be that drug delivered via an osmotic pump reaches therapeutic levels only after 16 to 18 h. Despite these caveats on the precise timing of its delivery, imatinib mesylate provides a significant level of protection pre- or postinfection, perhaps by allowing time for an effective immune response to develop, in a manner that does not interfere with acquisition of protective immune memory. Collectively, these data suggest that the potential utility of imatinib mesylate for treatment of poxvirus infections should be evaluated further. In this regard, prairie dogs may offer a means to assess the therapeutic value of imatinib mesylate for MPX infections ( 12a ). Similar to the case in the murine model, an inoculum of 5 × 10 4 PFU i.n. is used. However, this model is distinguished by the appearance of disseminated lesions or “pox” at 9 to 12 days postinfection, a phenotype previously observed only in"

Suppression of β-catenin reversed CSCs to a pre-CSC-like stage and reduced the growth of human MLL leukemic cells [ 48 ]. CSCs rely on Wnt/β-catenin pathway in addition to other important pathways like PI3K/Akt/mTOR and JAK/STAT for acquiring therapy resistance [ 49 ]. In chronic myelogenous leukemia, deletion of β-catenin synergized with imatinib resulted in a delay of disease recurrence after imatinib discontinuation [ 50 ]. Wnt pathway has been shown to be upregulated in mantle cell lymphoma-initiating cells (MCL-IL) [ 51 ].

In addition, imatinib is much less effective in advanced phase-CML as well as in Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), mainly due to the development of drug resistance. The challenge for the future is to improve current clinical results with kinase inhibitors in CML, developing strategies that can eradicate residual disease and overcome or prevent resistance. ‘Dual’ Src and Abl kinase inhibitors are an attractive class of compounds, since (a) these molecules are able to bind Bcr-Abl with less stringent conformational requirements with respect to imatinib, therefore allowing for efficient inhibition of several, resistance-associated mutant forms of Bcr-Abl; (b) Src kinases have been shown to be involved in Bcr-Abl-mediated leukemogenesis as well as upregulated in some patients resistant to imatinib. Here, we review the development, the mode of action and the preclinical or early clinical evaluation of several novel dual Src and Abl kinase inhibitors. \n Download PDF Introduction The deregulated tyrosine kinase activity of the Bcr-Abl chimeric protein, resulting from the t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation 1 on the 22q-derivative – most commonly referred to as the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome 2 – is essential for initiation and maintenance of 95% of chronic myeloid leukemias (CML) and 20% of acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). This has made the Abl kinase an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. The introduction of imatinib mesylate (formerly STI571; Gleevec™ or Glivec ® ) to the therapeutic armamentarium has changed the current management of CML. Imatinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, as well as of a limited number of other kinases (ABL, c-kit, PDGFR α and β , ARG and c-fms). 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 With imatinib therapy, a complete cytogenetic response has been reported in 50–60% of patients in chronic phase (CP) after interferon- α (IFN- α ) failure; 8 , 9 , 10 (Silver et al. Blood 2004; 104 : 23; abstract) and in 80–90% of patients in early-CP (Guilhot et al. Blood 2004; 104 : 21; abstract). 11 Imatinib is also effective in patients with CML in transformation. A hematologic response was achieved in approximately 80% of patients in accelerated phase (AP); 45% of them also achieved a major cytogenetic response (Silver et al. Blood 2004; 104 : 23; abstract). 10 , 12 In blast crisis (BC), 30% of"

In cancer medicine, targeted agents (e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors) have surfaced as commonly used therapeutic options for patients with a variety of malignancies. These small-molecule drugs are rapidly metabolized, and in fact, CYP3A4 is a major enzyme involved in their metabolism (e.g., Iressa, Tarceva, imatinib). Inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampicin) reduce blood exposure to the parent drug often to subtherapeutic levels. Because drug levels serve to identify both response [e.g., imatinib dose and tumor response type, chronic myelogenous leukemia (200 mg/day) versus gastrointestinal stromal tumors (400 mg/day)] and toxicity (e.g., imatinib steady-state levels and grade 3 edema), modifying drug levels from a single dose by controlling metabolism and unifying the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics would be beneficial. The same principles may apply to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors with regard to response-toxicity relationships (e.g., rash-predicting antitumor response). Finally, for cytotoxic drugs, unifying metabolism may"

Discussion The long-term outcome of imatinib treatment for metastatic GIST has emerged from several large trials. Approximately 45% of patients with metastatic GIST have a measurable response after administration of imatinib, whereas ∼30% will have at least stable disease ( 15 ). Although the 2-year survival of patients with metastatic GIST treated with imatinib approximates 72%, half of the patients develop disease progression by 2 years ( 3 ). Other investigators ( 1 2 ), with follow-up periods between 24 and 40 weeks, have reported similar rates of progression and resistance to imatinib therapy. In only a minority of cases, patients are insensitive to the drug, a so-called primary resistance.

This study investigated the roles of extracellular visfatin in breast cancer, and explored underlying mechanisms in clinical and experimental settings. Associations of serum visfatin with clinicopathologic characteristics and patient survival were assessed with Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Effects of extracellular visfatin on cultured breast cancer cells were examined, followed by in vivo investigation of tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft animal models. Imatinib and Stattic were used to inhibit c-Abl and STAT3 activation, respectively. Breast cancer patients with high serum visfatin levels were associated with advanced tumor stage, increased tumor size and lymph node metastasis, and poor survival. Elevated phosphorylation of c-Abl and STAT3 in breast tumor tissues were correlated with high serum visfatin levels in patients. Visfatin-promoted in vitro cell viability and metastatic capability were suppressed by imatinib (c-Abl inhibitor) and Stattic (STAT3 inhibitor). Increased in vivo cell invasiveness was observed in zebrafish xenografted with visfatin-pretreated breast cancer cells. Tumor growth and lung metastasis occurred in visfatin-administered mice xenografted with breast cancer cells. Tail vein-injected mice with visfatin-pretreated breast cancer cells showed increased lung metastasis, which was suppressed by imatinib. Serum visfatin levels in breast cancer patients reveal potential prognostic values, and our findings that visfatin promoted breast cancer through activation of c-Abl and STAT3 may provide an important molecular basis for future design of targeted therapies that take into account different serum visfatin levels in breast cancer.

Resistance often arises from second-line mutations in BCR-ABL or overexpression of the BCR-ABL protein but in ~20% of CML cases resistance mechanisms do not involve altered BCR-ABL function. Imatinib-resistant CML cell lines have been widely used for comparative proteome/genome-wide expression screens in order to decipher resistance mechanisms but a clearcut molecular mechanism or molecular player in BCR-ABL-independent resistance to Imatinib has not yet evolved from those studies. Here, we report the identification of a novel mechanism for Imatinib resistance in CML cells with unaltered BCR-ABL function. Pharmacological analysis evidenced a constitutive, Imatinib-insensitive activation of the Erk-MAPK pathway in resistant cells. A systematic analysis of pathway constituents illustrated that Ras-GTP accumulation remained fully sensitive to Imatinib but c-Raf activity from serum-fed cultures was largely resistant to the drug's action. Sequencing excluded mutations in either B-Raf or c-Raf as the origin of resistance, indicating that a functional alteration in the regulation of c-Raf activity was responsible for this effect. Collectively, these findings highlight a novel mechanism of acquired Imatinib resistance based on the BCR-ABL and Ras-independent constitutive activation of the Erk-MAPK pathway through activated c-Raf, which could prove helpful for a better functional classification of the causes of Imatinib resistance in CML. \n                               \n                                                            "

Although the etiology of RA remains unknown, macrophages, B cells, mast cells, and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) become activated in and contribute to synovial inflammation and joint destruction. In this article we explore protein tyrosine kinase inhibition with imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, formerly STI-571) as a strategy to specifically mitigate the pathogenic responses of macrophages, B cells, mast cells, and FLSs in autoimmune arthritis and RA. Imatinib is a small-molecule protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed to target the gene product of the Philadelphia chromosome Bcr / Abl translocation in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Imatinib was initially approved by the US and European regulatory agencies for the treatment of Bcr/Abl-positive CML ( 2 , 3 ) and more recently approved to treat c-Kit–expressing gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) based on its ability to antagonize c-Kit ( 2 , 3 ). Along with inhibiting Abl tyrosine kinases at submicromolar concentrations, imatinib specifically and potently inhibits a narrow spectrum of tyrosine kinases including c-Fms (IC 50 = 1.4 μM), c-Kit (IC 50 = 0.1 μM), and PDGFRα/β (IC 50 = 0.1 μM) ( 4 – 6 ).

While classic frequentist methods are still the most common approach used for indirect methods, 4 there is an increasing popularity and use of approaches such as Bayesian meta-analyses, as seen in workshops and courses at scientific meetings, as well as in the number of publications in high-tier journals. 8 Case study Background Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec ® /Glivec ® ; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland) was developed as the first available inhibitor with targeted activity against the constitutively active tyrosine kinase of the BCR–ABL chimeric fusion protein present in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and has become the current standard of care for CML due to remarkable long-term activity and a mild toxicity profile. 9 , 10 While imatinib is an effective, frontline treatment for patients with chronic phase CML, some patients are unable to respond to, become resistant to, or are unable to tolerate some of the side effects of imatinib, leaving few treatment options available. Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors with greater potency and less susceptibility to mutation-induced mechanisms of resistance have led the way in therapeutic approaches for patients who cannot be treated with imatinib. Nilotinib (Tasigna ® ; Novartis Pharmaceuticals and dasatinib (Sprycel ® ; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ) were developed as novel targeted therapies to address the challenges associated with developed resistance in patients treated with imatinib. In clinical trials, treatment with nilotinib or dasatinib has achieved strong hematologic and cytogenetic response in patients with CML with primary or secondary imatinib resistance or imatinib intolerance. Currently, no head-to-head studies are available comparing nilotinib with dasatinib, although data from single-arm studies suggest differences in both efficacy and safety between the two treatments. Clinical design differences for tyrosine kinase inhibitors While both nilotinib and dasatinib have been shown to be highly effective in chronic phase CML patients with imatinib resistance or intolerance, the pivotal investigations of these agents 11 , 12 were nonrandomized Phase II studies, making direct comparisons difficult. Moreover, the patient populations and protocols for each study were different, further complicating both efficacy and safety comparisons. Defining imatinib resistance The approval of dasatinib 70 mg twice daily was based on the SRC/ABL Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition Activity Research Trial (START-C) Phase II registration study. 12 However, more recently, a 100 mg once-daily dosing schedule was approved for chronic phase CML patients based on results from a Phase III dose and schedule optimization (2 × 2) study. 13 Nilotinib was approved based on results of the 2101 trial. 11 These studies used similar definitions of imatinib resistance that correspond with the European LeukemiaNet recommendations regarding failure to achieve hematologic and cytogenetic milestones or loss of responses, 14 with imatinib resistance defined as no complete hematologic response by three months; no minor cytogenetic response by six months; no major cytogenetic response by 12 months; and a loss of complete hematologic response or major cytogenetic response at any time. However, in the dasatinib Phase III dose optimization study, patients who tolerated imatinib 400 mg/day but who did not achieve a complete cytogenetic response after 12 months and were unable to tolerate imatinib dose escalation to 600 mg/day were still considered to be imatinib-resistant. Patients in a partial cytogenetic response or major cytogenetic response were thus eligible for the dasatinib dose optimization study. These patients were included in the imatinib-resistant population, despite the fact that many patients (20% in the 100 mg once-daily arm including intolerant patients) entered the study with a baseline major cytogenetic response. There were also differences in the dose and requirements for duration of prior imatinib therapy between the trials. In the nilotinib trial, imatinib-resistant patients were required to have received dose-escalated imatinib therapy with ≥600 mg/day for at least three months prior to trial enrollment. In contrast, there were no imatinib dose-escalation requirements for enrollment in the dasatinib studies. 11 , 12 Of chronic phase CML patients enrolled in the 2101 study, 72% received imatinib doses ≥600 mg/day (including 38% who received \u003e800 mg/day) as the highest prior imatinib dose. For patients in the dasatinib study, 72% of patients enrolled reported \u003e600 mg/day prior imatinib use, and 37% of patients in the dose optimization 2 × 2 study reported ≥800 mg/day imatinib prior to study enrollment. While the criteria between the nilotinib and dasatinib trials appear to be balanced with regards to imatinib resistance for enrollment, defining highest prior dose and duration of imatinib among the studies indicate differences that make comparisons challenging. Furthermore, the eligibility of patients with suboptimal responses to imatinib in the dasatinib 2 × 2 study also make it very difficult to compare efficacy data with the 2101 study data. Defining imatinib intolerance In the dasatinib START-C trial, imatinib intolerance was defined as at least Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity or Grade 4 hematologic toxicity persisting for \u003e7 days related to imatinib. 12 However, in the dasatinib 2 × 2 study, intolerance was defined as Grade 3 or worse toxicity that led to discontinuation of imatinib therapy. Imatinib intolerance was defined more stringently in the nilotinib trial, ie, patients without an major cytogenetic response and who discontinued for persistent Grade 3/4 adverse events despite optimal supportive care, or Grade 2 adverse events related to imatinib despite optimal supportive care persisting for ≥one month, or recurring \u003e three times with dose reduction or discontinuation. 11 Importantly, imatinib-intolerant patients achieving a major cytogenetic response following imatinib therapy were not eligible for participation in the nilotinib study. Overall, 84% of imatinib-intolerant patients enrolled into the nilotinib study did not have a major cytogenetic response. Of the imatinib-intolerant patients entering the study with a major cytogenetic response, a partial or complete cytogenetic response was observed in 40% of"

TKI therapy has been shown to benefit patients with various carcinomas in both the metastatic and adjuvant disease settings. These agents function by inhibiting growth factor receptors or their signaling partners, thereby turning off growth signals (see Figure 1). The management of metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) has been significantly improved by the use of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), which inhibits KIT, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), ABL, and TEL, and has served as a paradigm for the potential of targeted therapies. That said, GIST differs from most other malignancies, including other sarcomas. Biologically, GIST is driven by constitutive activation of the growth factors KIT or PDGFR, which occurs as a result of mutations in the corresponding genes. Unfortunately, we are unaware of relevant biologic targets in the majority of other sarcomas, and those that have been identified have not demonstrated significant clinical benefit when they have been targeted. Imatinib has been tested in various sarcomas other than GIST. The greatest activity has been seen in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), a cutaneous sarcoma that infrequently metastasizes. This tumor contains a characteristic translocation of chromosomes 17 and 22, resulting in a fusion protein of collagen 1A1 with PDGFR-beta.[22] Imatinib, which inhibits PDGFR, has benefited patients with large primary tumors and metastatic disease. The drug is the focus of ongoing clinical trials in DFSP and was recently approved for this indication by the FDA. Desmoid tumors have also been shown to potentially benefit from imatinib therapy, primarily as a consequence of tumor stabilization.[23,24] The underlying mechanism for this clinical finding is not clear. Soft-tissue and bone sarcomas have been shown to express members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family. EGFR has been demonstrated on malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), a rare type"

A number of compounds of the invention have also been found to possess potent in vitro activity against cancer cell lines, including among others K-562 leukemia cells. Observed potencies have been as much as 10-fold more powerful than Gleevec in conventional antiproliferation assays with K562 cells. Such compounds are thus of interest for the treatment of cancers, including both primary and metastatic cancers, including solid tumors as well as lymphomas and leukemias (including CML, AML and ALL), and including cancers which are resistant to other therapies, including other therapies involving the administration of kinase inhibitors such as Gleevec, Tarceva or Iressa. Such cancers include, among others, cancers of the breast, cervix, colon and rectum, lung, ovaries, pancreas, prostate, head and neck, gastrointestinal stroma, as well as diseases such as melanoma, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, melanoma, gastric cancers and leukemias (e.g., myeloid, lymphocytic, myelocytic and lymphoblastic leukemias) including cases which are resistant to one or more other therapies, including among others, Gleevec, Tarceva or Iressa. Resistance to various anticancer agents can arise from one or more mutations in a mediator or effector of the cancer (e.g. mutation in a kinase such as Src or Abl) which correlate with alteration in the protein's drug binding properties, phosphate binding properties, protein binding properties, autoregulation or other characteristics. For example, in the case of BCR-Abl, the kinase associated with chronic myeloid leukemia, resistance to Gleevec has been mapped to a variety of BCR/Abl mutations which are linked to a variety of functional consequences, including among others, steric hindrance of drug occupancy at the kinase's active site, alteration in deformability of the phosphate binding P loop, effects on the conformation of the activation loop surrounding the"

Eligibility criteria and monitoring were very similar to STIM, but the molecular recurrence definition was more stringent, with any two consecutive positive RQ‐PCR results triggering imatinib re‐treatment, even if there was no rise in BCR‐ABL1 from the first to the second test.

Based on the 2 studies published so far, imatinib mesylate may be the first effective drug in the treatment of metastatic GIST. The US–Finland study reported a response rate of 54% among 154 patients with inoperable or metastatic GIST, follow‐up being at least 6 months. 72 In addition, 28% had minor response or stable disease and only 14% showed primary resistance to the drug. Similar results were reported from the other trial, carried out by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer. 73 Of 36 patients treated with imatinib mesylate, 53% had confirmed partial responses and 17% had as yet unconfirmed partial responses or \u003e20% regression, while only 11% had progression. The optimum dose of imatinib mesylate in the treatment of GIST is not yet known and is being investigated in current randomized phase III trials.

On the basis of the actual 24-h proteinuria achieved one week after anti-thy1 antibody injection, the diseased animals were stratified assigned to the uni-nephrectomized, anti-thy1-injected animals, no treatment (cGS, n = 11) and uni-nephrectomized, anti-thy1-injected animals treated with Imatinib (cGS + Imatinib, n = 11) groups. Treatments were started seven days after antibody injection, to avoid interference with the induction of disease by anti-thy1 antibody. Imatinib is chemically designated as 4-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)medthyl]-N-[4-methyl-3-[[4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]-phenyl] benzamide methanesulfonate [ 12 ]. Imatinib is designed to specifically interact with the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding site of protein tyrosine kinases, a selective inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases Bcr-Abl, PDGF receptors, and c-kit [ 12 ]. It was given with the food at a daily dose of 10 mg/kg body weight. The dose was chosen on the basis of previous reports showing that this dose reduced diabetic nephropathy progression in rats [ 19 ]. The drug-containing food was produced by mixing Imatinib mesylate with the flour of the standard rat chow (22.5% protein, A1311, Altromin), and water was added to form pellets which were subsequently given to the animals after being air-dried [ 17 ]. In week 20, i.e. after 19 weeks of treatment, the actions of tyrosine kinases signal transduction inhibition by Imatinib on proteinuria, systolic blood pressure, matrix protein expansion, macrophage infiltration, cell proliferation and kidney function were determined. Glomerular and tubulointerstitial changes were analyzed separately. Glomeruli were isolated by a graded sieving technique. Since the renal cortex consists mainly of tubulointerstitial tissue (\u003e95%), it was used as representative for the tubulointerstitium."

Different drugs were tested for use as the internal standards. The choice of internal standard was based on it having similar chemical properties to those of the target analyte to be separated and on its absence in the endogenous sample to be analyzed. Imatinib has the same functional groups, a similar boiling point, and a similar pKa [ 21 ] to those of CVA. Therefore, in this investigation we used imatinib as an internal standard, which can be separated under optimized conditions from CVA. Under optimized conditions, CVA and the IS eluted at 2.780 and 1.293 min, respectively under the recommended LC–MS/MS conditions. Complete chromatographic elution of both CVA and IS was achieved within 4 min (Fig.  2 ). The system suitability parameters"

                    "potentially promising alternate approach for glioblastoma multiforme, brain metastases and primary central nervous system lymphoma is immune therapy (53). Active immunotherapy, which aims to stimulate or amplify the patient's own immune response, has shown promise. A common strategy is to provide antigen-presenting cells, usually dendritic cells, that have been made to express the target antigen (DC vaccine), but is still under development (53). Furthermore, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), which is used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and gastro-intestinal stromal tumors, has been shown to effectively inhibit PDGF-induced glioblastoma cell growth in preclinical studies. However, in clinical studies the effect is less pronounced and the results of Razis et al. (54) do not suggest a benefit from imatinib as a single agent in unselected glioblastoma multiforme patient populations, although imatinib was shown to be present in glioblastoma multiforme tissue and showed molecular effects in a subset of patients (54). In preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies it was shown that imatinib is a substrate drug of both P-gp and BCRP. Coadministration of BCRP and P-gp inhibitors, such as pantoprazole and elacridar, resulted in an increased brain penetration of imatinib (54). Other treatments which are currently under investigation for recurrent and high-grade glioblastoma in adults and/or children are bevacizumab, and/or sunitinib and/or sorafenib, all three inhibitors of VEGF and/or PDGFR, kinases which are involved in angiogenesis and glioblastoma cell growth.

Furthermore, treatment with dovitinib reduced the metabolic activity of GISTs in ∼ 47% of patients, with 13% of patients achieving mPR. As about half of our patients received dovitinib as fourth- or fifth-line therapy, these results suggest that dovitinib is clinically active in patients with GIST. Imatinib has revolutionised the treatment of advanced GISTs ( Demetri et al, 2002 ; Blanke et al, 2008 ). However, most patients develop resistance to and clinical progression on imatinib due to the development of secondary KIT mutations ( Antonescu et al, 2005 ; Heinrich et al, 2006 ; Gramza et al, 2009 ). Most of these acquired mutations occur in the regions of the KIT gene that encode the ATP/drug-binding pocket (exons 13 and 14) and the activation loop (exon 17) ( Antonescu et al, 2005 ; Heinrich et al, 2006 ; Wardelmann et al, 2006 ). Sunitinib is approved as the second-line therapy for GISTs after failure of imatinib, with a median PFS of about 7 months in a phase III trial ( Demetri et al, 2006 ). Sunitinib potently inhibits imatinib-resistant KIT exon 13 and 14 mutations, but has little activity against imatinib-resistant KIT exon 17 mutations ( Heinrich et al, 2008 ; Nishida et al, 2009 ; Heinrich et al, 2012 ). Although sunitinib inhibits VEGFR as well as KIT and PDGFR, it is still unclear whether VEGFR inhibition contributed to the activity of sunitinib against imatinib-resistant GISTs ( Heinrich et al, 2012 ). Because patients eventually progress on imatinib and sunitinib, and their prognosis is generally poor, many targeted agents have been investigated in this setting, including nilotinib ( Montemurro et al, 2009 ; Kim et al, 2011 ; Sawaki et al, 2011 ; Reichardt et al, 2012 ), sorafenib ( Wiebe et al, 2008 ; Montemurro et al,"

This strategy has been very successful as imatinib mesylate (STI-571, Gleevec/Glivec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland), a small molecule inhibitor of ABL kinase, has become the treatment of choice for BCR-ABL positive CML. 3 These results have been extended to solid tumors by targeting KIT in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), 4 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)."

                    "(GIST), the most common mesenchymal tumors originating in the digestive tract, have a characteristic morphology and are generally positive for CD117 (c-kit) and are primarily caused by activating mutations in the KIT or PDGFRa, both protein kinases in the Abelson-kinase family which are susceptible to treatment with ATKis. Just as found in the case of BCR-Abl associated cancers, KIT and/or PDGFRa associated GIST treated with frontline TKIs like imatinib can eventually develop resistance to therapy through the formation of secondary mutations in either KIT or PDGFRa; imatinib also displays poor response rates in KIT exon 9 and wildtype associated tumors, both of which are more responsive to higher affinity ATKis like sunitinib and regorafenib. Given the lower overall response rates of sunitinib and regorafenib relative to imatinib in front line therapy, the development of new agents with the broadest application in the manner of imatinib offers a likelihood of treatment success that will exceed the higher affinity agents like sunitinib and regorafenib. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one aspect, the invention provides compounds represented by general formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof: wherein, independently for each occurrence, R 1 is selected from hydrogen or lower alkyl; and Cy 1 is selected from substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl, and substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclyl, provided that Cy 1 is not unsubstituted pyrid-4-yl.

Pharmacokinetics suggest that the half-life of dasatinib of approximately 2 h in patients under the age of 20 years may be somewhat shorter compared with the more than 3 h in adults. Thus, changing the treatment to dasatinib in case of imatinib failure is probably the best option (M. Zwaan, personal communication). In adults, it appears that about 50% of those who fail imatinib due to resistance, and a slightly higher proportion of those who fail due to intolerance, will obtain longer-term benefit from switching to either nilotinib or dasatinib. 48 In young patients, there are not yet any data available on the use of nilotinib, so there is an urgent need for well-designed"

Abstract: Inhibitors of histone deacetylases are a new class of cancer therapeutics with possibly broad applicability. Combinations of HDAC inhibitors with the kinase inhibitor 1 (Imatinib) in recent studies showed additive and synergistic effects. Here we present a new concept by combining inhibition of protein kinases and HDACs, two independent pharmacological activities, in one synthetic small molecule. In general, the HDAC inhibition profile, the potencies, and the probable binding modes to HDAC1 and HDAC6 were similar as for 6 (SAHA). Inhibition of Abl kinase in biochemical assays was maintained for most compounds, but in general the kinase selectivity profile differed from that of 1 with nearly equipotent inhibition of the wild-type and the Imatinib resistant Abl T(315)I mutant. A potent cellular inhibition of PDGFR and cytotoxicity toward EOL-1 cells, a model for idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), are restored or enhanced for selected analogues (12b, 14b, and 18b). Cytotoxicity was evaluated by using a broad panel of tumor cell lines, with selected analogues displaying mean"

An excellent paper by Fujita et al . shows two unanticipated results with respect to ABL1 localization in the presence of the ABL kinase inhibitor STI571 (imatinib), which, based on structural data, is thought to keep ABL1 in a closed, autoinhibited conformation. First, green fluorescent protein-tagged ABL1 dynamically localizes to the very edge of lamellipodia, and this is enhanced by STI571. Second, the amino-terminal myristoyl group of ABL1, which is only accessible in the open conformation, is required for this translocation. This suggests that, in contrast to the structural evidence, STI571-bound ABL1 is in an open conformation in living cells. Unlike the study by Stradal et al . that showed ABI"

Animal data suggest that imatinib at standard dosages is unlikely to impair fertility in either adult males or females but human data remain limited. Children born to men who are actively taking imatinib at the time of conception appear healthy and current advice is not to discontinue treatment. In contrast the data relating to children born to women exposed to imatinib during pregnancy are less encouraging. Although numbers are small there has been a disturbing cluster of rare congenital malformations such that imatinib cannot be safely recommended, particularly during the period of organogenesis. The appropriate management of children with CML has also been radically changed by the advent of imatinib. The features of the disease at presentation, the natural history and the response to therapy seem to be identical in children to that seen in adults. Now that imatinib has been in clinical use for almost ten years without severe long-term side effects, most physicians are now comfortable advising a trial of imatinib prior to consideration of transplant. Data relating to the efficacy and safety of second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors in childhood is entirely absent and transplant remains the first choice for patients failing imatinib and perhaps also for young patients with sub-optimal responses. \n                               \n                                                "

In fact, the number of apoptotic cells was substantially higher in rapamycin‐treated cultures compared with cells kept in control medium (Fig. 5 B ). Since growth inhibition may be associated with induction of differentiation, we also asked whether rapamycin induces differentiation in K562 cells as has been reported for imatinib ( 42 ). For this purpose, K562 cells were exposed to imatinib (0.5 µM) or rapamycin (20 nM) and analyzed for expression of glycophorin A by flow cytometry. However, whereas imatinib was found to promote expression of glycophorin‐A, no effect of rapamycin was seen (Fig. 6 ). All in all, these data suggest that rapamycin suppresses the growth of CML cells through induction of cell cycle arrest and by increasing the rate of apoptosis without inducing differentation, whereas imatinib also induces differentiation in K562 cells. Rapamycin does not inhibit growth of CML cells through down‐regulation of expression of VEGF We and others have previously shown that VEGF is expressed in primary CML cells ( 34 , 43 – 45 ) and that rapamycin counteracts Bcr‐Abl‐dependent production of VEGF in"

MN is rarely found in children, and the efficacy of imatinib on pediatric patients remain unclear. We report 2 pediatric cases diagnosed with MN with eosinophilia and PDGFRB rearrangement who were treated with imatinib. Case 1 was a 1-year-old girl admitted to the hospital because of \"abdominal distension with hyperleukocytosis for 3 mo\". She had leukocytosis, anemia, and eosinophilia (the absolute eosinophil count (AEC) was 8960/μL), and her fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test revealed that PDGFRB rearrangement was detected in 70% of 500"

However, no consensus has been drawn on what represents an optimal response. A 3-log reduction in BCR–ABL transcripts after 1 month of imatinib therapy has been shown to predict a reduced relapse risk [ 118 ], as no rapid achievement of BCR–ABL negativity was described for achieving a long-term outcome [ 119 ]. However, MRD at 3 months has better discrimination for OS and relapse-free survival than did MRD status at CR. Patients"

The available agents have varying affinities for the different tyrosine kinases, but none is specific for a single tyrosine kinase, and they may also affect other off-target intracellular processes ( 44 ). Two types of thyroid disturbance can be seen with TKIs. The first is a recurrence of hypothyroidism in patients with preexisting hypothyroidism under satisfactory treatment with thyroid hormone. This effect is seen with imatinib, sorafenib, and motesanib but has not yet been reported with sunitinib ( 45 – 49 ). A prospective study ( 45 ) investigating the use of imatinib for the treatment of metastatic medullary thyroid cancer showed that all eight patients on previously stable doses of levothyroxine hormone replacement after thyroidectomy developed grossly increased levels of TSH (average TSH level increased from 1.32 to 23.83 mIU/L) and reduced serum free T4 levels (average free T4 level decreased from 1.45 to 1.09 ng/dL) within 2 weeks of starting this agent. Despite doubling the dose of levothyroxine, the TSH only normalized in three patients. TSH levels returned to normal after discontinuing imatinib ( 45 ). Similar effects have been seen in thyroidectomized thyroid cancer patients with other TKIs, such as sorafenib and motesanib ( 46 – 49 ). For imatinib, this effect on thyroid function appears to be limited to patients with hypothyroidism who are taking exogenous thyroid hormone replacement because studies in patients with normal pretreatment thyroid function showed no change in hormone levels ( 50 ). The TSH elevation is likely attributable to the accelerated clearance of thyroid"

These seven patients with tumor regression remained free of tumor progression for 4 to 14 months, as compared with two patients with BRAF wild-type who showed progressive disease. These observations suggest the novel antitumor activity of PLX4032 against tumors with V600E BRAF mutations. Subsequent phase II and III trials of PLX4032 are under way. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec TM , Novartis), is a selective and competitive inhibitor of various tyrosine kinases such as KIT, BCR-ABL, ABL and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGF-Rs) [ 45 ]. For instance, Gleevec binds to the active site of the mutationally active tyrosine kinase KIT and inhibits the protein, thereby stopping cellular signaling and turning off tumor growth. Two phase II trials evaluating the effects of imatinib in metastatic melanoma revealed a lack of clinical efficacy of the drug because of its high toxicity and low median overall survival and median time to progression [ 46 , 47 ].

Extensive κ-deleting Element (KDE) Rearrangement Results in Preferential λ-light Chain Expression on STI571-surviving Leukemia Cells. Searching for a potential explanation for predominant λ-light chain expression on differentiating leukemia cells surviving STI571 treatment, we investigated whether rearrangement of the so-called KDE may contribute to reduced κ light chain usage in STI571-treated leukemia cells. KDE rearrangement may lead to inactivation of productively recombined Vκ-Jκ joints and, hence, represents another level at which Ig light chain expression can be regulated ( 28 ). We amplified specific DNA fragments for KDE-germline configuration, KDE rearrangement to an RSS within the Jκ intron, and KDE rearrangement to RSS sites flanking Vκ gene segments from three BCR-ABL1 + leukemia cells in the absence or presence of STI571. Although KDE was found in germline configuration in untreated leukemia cells, STI571-mediated inhibition of BCR-ABL1 was associated with rearrangement of KDE to Jκ intron RSS sites and, to a lesser extent, to Vκ RSS sites (not depicted). Thus, predominant expression of λ light chains is consistent with extensive KDE rearrangement"

These mutations in GIST are targeted by molecular drugs, such as imatinib 5 , 6 . Despite the use of such specific drugs that alter the treatment scenario, resistance leads to recurrence in a substantial number of patients.

Although the measures were different between the two studies, several explanations may be plausible. For example, patients who are already on a medication regimen may be less likely to forget to take their imatinib; or patients who have comorbid conditions requiring drug therapy may be more concerned about their health, fearful of the risk of relapse, knowledgeable about their diseases and treatments, or have more frequent contact and communication with their physicians, pharmacists, and nurses. While for most patients imatinib has relegated CML to a manageable chronic disease, this may prove to be a double-edged sword. There no longer is the dire diagnosis, shortened life expectancy, and high mortality. Patients and their clinicians begin treatment with the belief that remission is assured. Yet, over time, they may be lulled into"

Many mechanisms of imatinib-resistance have been observed, and the most common is believed to be the restoration of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity via decreased drug binding (Nardi et al., 2003). The first mutation reported to accomplish that was T315I (Gorre, 2001), and reports of many others followed. If imatinib binding failure is the key problem in resistance, drug design, in specific embodiments, should focus on more effective ways to block BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity. Exemplary data of the present invention, however, showed that the phosphorylation levels of BCR-ABL and its downstream targets CrkL and Akt were lower in imatinib-resistant patients than in imatinib-naive patients, indicating that imatinib resistance in the patient population was not the result of poor drug binding and reversion to high levels of BCR-ABL signaling. While binding site mutations undoubtedly confer a survival advantage, especially those that predate imatinib therapy, they are more likely to exist in a subpopulation of leukemic clones that are able to contribute to disease progression (Nardi, 2003). The finding that STAT5 phosphorylation levels in imatinib-resistant and -naive patients did not significantly differ despite the demonstrated decreases in activity of known upstream signaling effectors in"

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 . Effect of TKI (imatinib) on digital ulcers, interstitial lung disease, and collagen architecture in a patient with SSc. (A) Digital ulcer located over the left fourth proximal interphalangeal joint prior to imatinib therapy. (B) Healing of digital ulcer after 3 months of imatinib therpy. (C) HRCT of the chest prior to imatinib therapy demonstrates patchy infiltrates associated with ground glass opacities in the bilateral lower lobes. (D) HRCT after 3 months of imatinib therapy shows resolution of ground glass opacities. (E) Hematoxylin and eosin stained skin biopsy from the right arm taken prior to imatinib therapy shows dense, eosinophilic, tightly packed collagen bundles of the papillary and reticular dermis with an average dermal thickness of 2.81 mm (Magnification 100×). (F) Skin biopsy after 3 months of imatinib taken within 1 cm of initial biopsy shows normalization of collagen architecture, with loose spacing and thinning of collagen bundles and an average dermal thickness of 2.31 mm. FIG. 2 . Imatinib reduces PDGFRb and Abl activation in SSc skin and function in SSc fibroblasts. (A-D) Immunohistochemical staining of serial skin biopsy samples obtained pre-treatment (A,C) and one month following the initiation of imatinib treatment (B,D) with anti-phospho-PDGFRb (A,B) and anti-phospho-Abl (C,D) antibodies. Boxed areas of upper panels (200× magnification), are presented at higher magnification in their corresponding lower panels (600×).

It is perhaps not surprising, then, that considerably less attention has been directed toward examining the role of the hematopoietic microenvironment (HM) in the initiation and progression of leukemia.

The remainder demonstrated significant changes in morphology (from spheroidal to ellipsoidal and vice versa) over time, while the RECIST measure did not reflect such changes. The morphology of LM in GIST is rarely spherical (an underlying assumption for RECIST) and can change considerably during imatinib therapy. In this setting, measurements using RECIST do not reflect changes in size and morphology. Additionally, whilst V(ELLIPSOID) is a more suitable surrogate for volume estimation, it is still somewhat limited by the morphology and orientation of such lesions.

The inhibitory effect of resveratrol on IM‐S and IM‐R cell proliferation was further confirmed in colony formation assays in methyl cellulose that more specifically measured a proliferation index. Indeed, as depicted in Fig. 1 C, D , resveratrol dose dependently reduced the proliferation potential of IM‐S and IM‐R clones. Inhibition was detected for concentrations of resveratrol as low as 1 μM. As expected, imatinib was found to abrogate proliferation of the IM‐S but not that of the IM‐R clone (Fig. 1 C, D ). In a second set of experiments, the effects of various doses of resveratrol were tested in combination with different doses of imatinib. Imatinib induced a dose‐dependent decrease of cell metabolism in IM‐S cells but not in its IM‐R counterpart as expected ( Fig. 2 A, B ). According to the results of Fig. 1 , resveratrol drastically decreased cell metabolism in both IM‐S and IM‐R cells; however, there was a more pronounced effect in the latter cell line. Interestingly, the combination of resveratrol and imatinib was found to exert additive effects on cell metabolism. Resveratrol blocks IM‐S and IM‐R cells in the G 0 /G 1 phase of the cell cycle The percentage of cells in individual cell‐cycle phases was assessed during incubation with imatinib or different concentrations of resveratrol. Representative histograms are shown in Fig. 3 . A marked decrease of the cell fraction with fully replicated DNA (G 2 /M) occurs within 24 h after imatinib addition in IM‐S K562 cells (Fig. 3 A ). This correlated with an increased proportion of cells in the G 0 /G 1 phase of the cell cycle. Later on, an increasing number of cells accumulated in the subG 1 phase of the cell cycle in the presence of imatinib (Fig. 3 C ). Neither a decrease in G 2 /M nor a G 0 /G 1 or subG 1 accumulation was detected in IM‐R cells on imatinib treatment (Fig. 3 B, D ). Resveratrol increased the percentage of cells in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle and reduced the fraction of cells in G 2 /M in both IM‐S and IM‐R cells after 24 h (Fig. 3 A, B ).

In a recent study of c-Abl conformational energetics and dynamics using NMR spectroscopy, it was found that many of these distal resistance mutations have no effect on imatinib binding thermodynamics, but rather they perturbed the relative populations of the active and inactive states ( Saleh et al. 2017 ).

DISCUSSION The introduction of imatinib mesylate, a small-molecule drug rationally developed to inhibit the tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL, but also affecting ABL-related kinase, KIT, PDGF receptor α, and PDGFRB, has revolutionized the therapy of advanced GI stromal tumors and chronic myelogenous leukemia. 47 , 49 – 53 The spectacular efficacy of imatinib in these neoplasms resulted in a model of targeted therapy in oncology. The observation that autocrine overproduction of PDGFB as a result of gene rearrangement is a key factor in DFSP pathogenesis 27 , 36 , 37 provoked in vitro research that showed inhibition of DFSP cell growth exposed to imatinib. 43 The further demonstration of the inhibitory effect of imatinib on six different DFSP cell lines 38 , 54 led to the clinical investigation of this new therapeutic approach. Early anecdotal reports suggested significant activity of imatinib in patients with metastatic or advanced DFSP. 44 , 45 , 55 – 60 A subset analysis of 10 patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic DFSP treated in Imatinib Target Exploration Consortium Study B2225 reported a 100% response rate in the nine patients with documented t(17;22); whereas the patients with DFSP lacking t(17;22) experienced progression. 46 , 61 As a result of these observations, imatinib was registered for therapy of inoperable and/or metastatic DFSP. The purpose of our combined analysis of two phase II trials was to provide more statistical power for the evaluation of the objective clinical response rate of locally advanced and/or metastatic DFSP to imatinib and to assess the safety of this therapy. We report here the largest prospectively collected cohort of locally advanced/metastatic DFSP and confirm the excellent activity of imatinib in this selected group of poor-prognosis patients. We have demonstrated a DFSP response rate of 46%, a 1-year progression-free survival rate of 58%, and a median TTP of 1.7 years with treatment with imatinib. Although there were notable differences in trial design, the observed response rate at 14 to 16 weeks and progression-free survival rate at 1 year were remarkably similar between the studies, suggesting that a daily dose of 400 mg has similar efficacy to 800 mg daily. Most of the previously reported patients had been treated with doses of imatinib exceeding 400 mg daily. We have also found that DFSP-FS retains sensitivity to imatinib, although responses may be less durable. 34 , 62 DFSP-FS tumors lacking t(17;22) 46 , 63 do not respond to imatinib, suggesting misdiagnosis of disease or loss of tumor dependence on the PDGFR signaling pathway. Therefore, we advocate testing for the presence of t(17;22) in DFSP-FS before therapy with imatinib, especially in the neoadjuvant setting. Wide surgical excision is the standard curative treatment for localized DFSP but may result in cosmetic disfigurement or functional impairment. Preoperative imatinib therapy to diminish tumor size and decrease surgical morbidity is attractive, in theory, if excellent cure rates can be obtained. Our results demonstrated that some patients with DFSP initially evaluated as having unresectable disease or requiring mutilating surgery were able to undergo resection after imatinib therapy ( Fig 2 and Appendix Figs A1 and A2, online only). This rational treatment approach led to complete remission after surgery in four patients and seems to have been curative, although longer follow-up is needed. Lebbé et al 64 presented a preliminary report on 25 patients with resectable DFSP treated in a phase II trial with preoperative imatinib at a dose of 600 mg daily for 2 months. Objective PR was observed in nine patients (36%), which may be inferior to our results but might be explained by the shorter duration of treatment and/or lack of confirmation of PDGFB rearrangement. The optimal duration of preoperative imatinib therapy in patients with DFSP has not been established. Further studies are necessary for elucidating whether imatinib therapy reduces the need for wide surgical margins or whether imatinib has activity as adjuvant therapy in patients with positive margins after excision. Open in a separate window Fig 2. (A) Multiple, recurrent tumors of the scalp, and (B) clinical complete response maintained for more than 3 years on imatinib therapy. The safety profile in our group of patients was as expected and consistent with that seen in published clinical trials of imatinib in GI stromal tumors. 47 , 49 , 52 The majority of patients experienced adverse effects during treatment, but almost all were graded as mild. Questions remain about the mechanisms of imatinib action and resistance in DFSP, and there is a need to identify additional molecular markers for predicting response to such treatment. It was presumed that the effect of imatinib resulted from inhibition of phosphorylation of PDGFRB. However, clinical activity of imatinib in DFSP is striking even in DFSP expressing relatively low amounts of activated PDGFRB. 38 , 48 In our trials, we have not studied molecular changes during targeted therapy, but the high clinical benefit rate observed for imatinib in our patients supports the hypothesis of dependence of growth and viability of DFSP cells on aberrant activation of the imatinib-sensitive kinase PDGFRB. It seems that inhibition of low-level receptor tyrosine kinase activity may be effective clinically if tumor cells are dependent on that signaling mechanism. This paradigm may be also operational in pigmented villonodular synovitis/tenosynovial giant-cell tumor. 65 , 66 With a clearer understanding of the downstream effects of interactions of imatinib with PDGFRB in DFSP, additional treatment strategies may become evident. In summary, we have confirmed that therapy with imatinib has profound antitumor effects in advanced DFSP harboring t(17;22), with an objective response rate approaching 50%, and that this therapy is also active in DFSP-FS. The efficacy of imatinib in DFSP seems to be discriminative, in part, to tumor retaining the translocation involving COL1A1 and PDGFB . Although DFSP rarely presents as inoperable, imatinib is an effective treatment in such patients and may allow for complete resection of initially inoperable tumors. Because there was no obvious difference between response rates and TTP in patients receiving imatinib 400 mg versus 800 mg daily, 400 mg daily may be used as a starting dose.

                    "( Zenz et al., 2008 ), whether this mutation is present in Abl-induced human leukemias and provides prognostic significance in these leukemias has still to be determined. Activation of PI3K/AKT pathway has emerged as one of the essential signaling mechanisms in Abl oncogene-induced leukemogenesis ( Kharas and Fruman, 2005 ). Further mutation analysis of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway will therefore be valuable in understanding primary or acquired resistance to imatinib treatment in these leukemias. Our experiments have also provided insight into the mechanism by which AKT1(E17K) may affect survival of Abl transformants. First, our study data revealed that E17K mutation increases AKT1 activation in v-Abl transformants. Because AKT signaling is an important regulator of apoptosis, we then tested whether AKT1(E17K) alters apoptosis profile in v-Abl-transformed cells. Previous study suggested that resistance to apoptosis in v-Abl-transformed pre-B cells is associated with increased expression of antiapoptotic protein BCL2 ( Banerjee and Rothman, 1998 ). However, inhibition of the Abl kinase activity with imatinib downregulates the expression of this antiapoptotic protein and induces apoptosis in v-Abl transformants. Importantly, we observed that expression of AKT1(E17K) resulted in upregulation of BCL2 expression and phosphorylation of BAD, thereby suppressing apoptosis induced by imatinib. The results reveal an antiapoptotic pathway triggered by AKT1(E17K) that contributes to the resistance of Abl-expressing cells to undergo imatinib-mediated apoptosis. These findings may be useful not only to understand the mechanisms by which AKT1(E17K) promotes tumor development, but also to lead to the idea that multidrug regiments that specifically"

Therapeutic Potential for Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Solid Tumors The development of TKIs to treat patients with BCR-ABL1-positive leukemias is the best example of the successful application of targeted therapy. In contrast to the success of ATP-competitive inhibitors imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib in treating BCR-ABL1-induced leukemias, treatment of diverse solid tumors with these compounds has not achieved similar success (Ganguly et al., Genes \u0026 Cancer, 2012; Puls et al., The Oncologist, 2011). Drugs such as imatinib and nilotinib, shown to inhibit ABL kinases, have demonstrated mixed effectiveness for the treatment of solid tumors. The variable clinical responses to these TKIs may be due to the lack of the relevant oncogenic target, the presence of additional mutations driving the tumor, tumor heterogeneity, and/or dynamic reprogramming of signaling networks in response to TKI treatment (Stuhlmiller, et al., Cell Rep., 2014; Duncan et al., Cell, 2012). An alternative mechanism that underlies the poor response to TKI therapy is the paradoxical activation of proliferative pathways as a result of unintended targeting of other kinases. Imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib, which have multiple cellular targets, drive the paradoxical activation of BRAF/C-RAF complexes leading to enhanced activation of the MEK-ERK pathway. This was demonstrated by the activation of BRAF/RAF1 complexes leading to enhanced activation of the MEK-ERK pathway by nilotinib, imatinib, and dasatinib in melanoma, lung, colorectal, pancreatic carcinoma cells, and BCR-ABL1 TKI-resistant leukemic cells expressing activated RAS (Packer et al., Cancer Cell, 2011). It is clear that the use ATP-competitive inhibitor drugs is inadequate for the treatment of solid tumors as monotherapies owing to the complexity of mutations even in"

The anti-depressant, Duloxetine, inhibits the uptake of two discrete neuropeptides, serotonin and noradrenaline. The anti-cancer drugs, Gleevec and Sutent, developed to inhibit the EGF receptor, were found to target multiple kinases.

[Parag P Patwardhan, Oliver Surriga, Michael J Beckman, Elisa de Stanchina, Ronald P Dematteo, William D Tap, Gary K Schwartz] PMID 24718867 Abstract Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a highly aggressive tumor type that is resistant to chemotherapy and there are no effective therapies. MPNSTs have been shown to have gene amplification for receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), PDGFR and c-Kit. We tested the c-Kit inhibitor, imatinib, and PLX3397, a selective c-Fms and c-Kit inhibitor, to evaluate their efficacy against MPNST cells in vitro and in vivo. We tested the efficacy of imatinib or PLX3397 either alone or in combination with TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin in a cell proliferation assay in vitro and by immunoblotting to determine target inhibition. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis was further carried out using xenograft samples in vivo. Our in vitro studies show that imatinib and PLX3397 similarly inhibit cell growth and this can be enhanced with rapamycin with comparable target specificity. However, in vivo studies clearly demonstrate that compared with imatinib, PLX3397 results in sustained blockade of c-Kit, c-Fms, and PDGFRβ, resulting in significant suppression of tumor growth. Moreover, staining for Iba-1, a marker for macrophages, indicates that PLX3397 results in significant depletion of macrophages in the growing tumors. The combination of PLX3397 and rapamycin results in even greater macrophage depletion with continued growth suppression, even when the drug treatment is discontinued. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that PLX3397 is superior to imatinib in the treatment of MPNSTs, and the combination of PLX3397 with a TORC1 inhibitor could provide a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of this disease.

Induction of PU.1 expression by JAK2 V617F in JAK2-wildtype K562 cells and its downregulation by JAK2 siRNA transfection in JAK2 V617F-positive HEL cells supported this possibility. We also found that the ABL1 kinase inhibitor imatinib was very effective in suppressing PU.1 expression in BCR-ABL1-positive K562 cells but not in HEL cells. This suggests that PU.1 expression is regulated by both JAK2 and ABL1. The contribution of the two kinases in driving PU.1 expression was dominant for JAK2 and ABL1 in HEL and K562 cells, respectively."

Currently, actively growing and clinically symptomatic schwannomas are managed with surgery or radiosurgery, each with some short- and long-term risks ( 4 – 9 ). A management alternative that could blunt or regress the growth of the schwannoma, and be taken on a prolonged basis, would potentially stabilize the clinical symptoms and defray active intervention, especially in high-risk patients. Gleevec was the first targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor to show efficacy in the clinic, revolutionizing the current management of CML harboring the bcr-abl oncogene ( 19 – 21 ). Gleevec blocks the kinase activity of abl and inhibits the growth of bcr-abl–driven cell lines in vitro with an IC 50 of 1 μmol/L ( 21 ). This concentration is readily achieved in vivo , with minimal host toxicity. In addition to its minimal toxicity, Gleevec inhibits other receptor tyrosine kinases such as c-kit and PDGFRs, thereby expanding its potential use in other human cancers. For example, Gleevec has shown clinical efficacy in the management of GIST, characterized by c-kit mutational activation or, rarely, PDGFR-α mutational activation ( 23 ). Gleevec has also shown efficacy in c-kit–positive small-cell lung cancer cell lines ( 25 ), PDGFR-expressing glioblastoma cells ( 24 ), and other myeloproliferative disorders characterized by activation of PDGFRβ ( 22 ).

In all, the Ph chromosome disappeared, while the 5 cases, additional abnormalities [dup(1); del(5), +8 (2 patients) and +14] persisted in the subsequent studies, performed over a period of 11 to 49 months, either alone or together with a karyotypically normal cell population. This finding is consistent with a secondary origin of the Ph chromosome in these patients. It is still to early to evaluate the possible prognostic value of these additional abnormalities. \n The emergence of chromosome abnormalities in Ph negative (Ph) cells during Imatinib treatment in CML patients has been widely observed although origin and prognostic significance are still uncertain. However, a few patients carry chromosome changes in addition to the Ph chromosome since diagnosis have been reported.1–3 In these cases, imatinib treatment induces the disappearance of the Ph population, allowing the clone marked by the additional abnormality alone to persist. This observation may have important prognostic and pathogenetic implications. Based on some of our initial observations, we contacted the 54 Cytogenetics Laboratories participating in the GIMEMA CML Working Party Group. Out"

The comparator was BMT with a matched unrelated donor, and the base case was defined as a 35-year-old, Ph(+) man with newly diagnosed CML. The Monte Carlo microsimulation indicated that the incremental cost:efficacy ratio was -$5000 for imatinib (95% confidence interval -$70,000-84,000). Analysis of the cost-efficacy plane revealed that imatinib was dominant over BMT in 84.69% of cases, whereas BMT dominated imatinib in 0.76% of cases. Trade-offs were warranted in the remaining cases. Sensitivity analyses of costs and discount rates found these results to be generally robust.

Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that VE-cadherin in PBS-treated HRMECs appeared as a continuous line at the endothelial cell–cell junction ( Figure 3C ). However, the treatment with SCF induced a focal loss in the staining of VE-cadherin at endothelial borders and increased staining for the punctate form of intracellular VE-cadherin that was colocalized with the endosomal marker EEA1. Pretreatment of imatinib mesylate or SU6656 substantially blocked SCF-induced internalization of VE-cadherin. However, the treatment with imatinib mesylate or SU6656 alone did not change the distribution of VE-cadherin relative to that observed in the PBS-treated control. Having examined murine retinal vasculature, we observed that intravitreal injection of SCF induced the disappearance of the VE-cadherin signal from the retinal vasculature ( Figure 3D ). However, intraperitoneal injections of imatinib mesylate or PP2 before SCF injection abolished the SCF-mediated focal loss of VE-cadherin in the retinal endothelium. These results support the notion that SCF-induced activation of cKit and Src leads to internalization of VE-cadherin in the retinal vasculature.

Furthermore, we found that the T338A mutation made Hck almost 50 times more sensitive to NaPP1 than the wild-type kinase in vitro , without inducing sensitivity to imatinib.

The top five most likely mutants are sensitive to maxitinib K1, the second through sixth most likely mutants are sensitive to maxitinib K2, and so on ( Figure 4G ; see STAR Methods and GitHub for a model description). The model predicts a 67% reduction in resistance incidence relative to imatinib for maxitinib K1, the hypothetical chemotype that targets the five most likely mutants ( Figure 4H ). This reduction is larger than either nilotinib or dasatinib (even though at least as many mutations confer resistance to maxitinib K1 as to nilotinib or dasatinib), and predicts that the evolutionarily optimal chemotype would prevail in the clinic. At the same time, maxitinib K15, which targets the five least likely mutants, offers virtually no advantage over imatinib. To be sure that the most prevalent resistance allele, T315I, was not dominating the observed effect, we removed T315I from the model and reperformed the simulations.

Full size image Furthermore, we used K562 cells, a p210 Bcr−Abl positive myeloid cell line established from a CML patient at the stage of blast crisis, to test tyrosine kinase-dependent activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 GTPases by p210 Bcr−Abl . Results showed that blocking p210 Bcr−Abl kinase activity with Gleevec in K562 cells reduced endogenous Cdc42 activity markedly and Rac1 activity to a lesser extent ( Figures 2a and b ). Furthermore, the repression of Cdc42 activity by Gleevec treatment seemed to be time- and dosage-dependent in K562 cells (data not shown), suggesting that p210 Bcr−Abl kinase activity is required for sustained Cdc42 activation. Owing to the lack of CXCR4 expression, K562 cells did not show SDF-1α response (data not shown). Effect of inhibiting p210 Bcr−Abl PTK on Cdc42 and Rac1 activities, and SDF-1α chemotaxis in Ph(+) primary cells from CML patients To extend these findings to a more clinically relevant condition, we isolated primary mononuclear cells from BM cells of two Ph(+) CML patients and treated these cells with Gleevec in serum-containing and serum-free medium for Cdc42/Rac activity assays. Cdc42 activity was decreased by more than 30% in both serum-containing and serum-free media by inhibiting p210 Bcr−Abl kinase ( Figure 3a ). Meanwhile, endogenous Rac1 activity was also reduced by Gleevec treatment in Ph(+) cells ( Figure 3b ). We further used Boyden chamber assay to examine the effect of Gleevec treatment on SDF-1α-dependent directional migration in cells isolated from BM of these two Ph(+) patients ( Figure 3c ). Consistently, Gleevec treatment was able to increase the migration capacity of the patient CML cells toward SDF-1α. Again, these results showed that the decrease in Cdc42 and Rac1 activities due to the inhibition of tyrosine kinase of p210 Bcr−Abl is closely associated with the increase of SDF-1α-directed migration in CML cells. Figure 3 Inhibition of p210 Bcr−Abl tyrosine kinase decreases Cdc42/Rac1 activities and restores chemotaxis in primary Ph(+) cells. ( a and b ) Primary mononuclear cells isolated from BM samples were maintained in serum-containing or serum-free RPMI 1640 medium treated with or without Gleevec (5 μ M ) for 18 h. Representative CML cells from Ph(+)1 and Ph(+)2 patients were collected and lysed for Cdc42/Rac1 activity assays.

The results of ctDNA testing can shed light on primary driver mutations, as well as resistance mutations that could arise following treatment with imatinib (Gleevec). GIST comprises about 10 subtypes with different driver mutations, including KIT , PDGFRα , neurofibromatosis type 1, RAS , and succinate dehydrogenase deficiency, Trent says. Understanding what mutation is driving the disease can inform treatment selection for patients, Trent explains. For example, patients with RAS -driven GIST will benefit from"

However, conformational selection happens before drug binding, and the intrinsic slow DFG- in to DFG- out interconversion in Aurora A revealed by Gleevec binding ( Figure 3A ) must, therefore, be unaltered.

Contemplated Diagnostic Assays and Methods While it is well known that LEF1 transcripts are up-regulated in the blast phase of CML, translation of these mRNAs has not been examined. Here, the inventors surprisingly discovered that LEF-1 is a target of Bcr-Abl since production of LEF1 mRNA and LEF-1 protein are down-regulated by the Bcr-Abl inhibitor, imatinib. Therefore, LEF-1 appears to be a target of Bcr-Abl signaling and may contribute to the increased survival and proliferation of myeloid progenitor populations. Based on these and other considerations, it is contemplated that LEF-1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of CML (as has previously been demonstrated by the capability of LEF-1 protein to transform cells, and as LEF-1 is uniformly expressed in all primary CML samples tested). Furthermore, the degree to which LEF-1 translation/expression could be inhibited by imatinib in vitro correlated with clinical outcome, since it was found that a lack of inhibition was associated with the eventual development of clinical imatinib-resistance. These observations also indicate that LEF-1 expression may play a role in conferring drug resistance. Of the known mechanisms associated with clinical imatinib-resistance, Abl kinase domain"

[Araceli Tobío, Amparo Alfonso, Luis M Botana] PMID 24982339 Abstract The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, STI571 and dasatinib effects and protein kinase C (PKC) status in HMC-1(560) and HMC-1(560,816) cell lines. Viability results were obtained by two different methods: MTT and a flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC/PI double-staining protocol. The lipid-based transfection method was used to silence PKC. Long-term PKC activation induces apoptosis in both HMC-1 cell lines. Moreover, PKC activation potentiates STI571 and dasatinib cytotoxic effects in HMC-1(560) and HMC-1(560,816) cells, respectively, by increasing necrotic populations. To investigate this PKC effect, the role of PKCδ, an isoform intimately related with apoptotic cell death, was studied. The results obtained evidence that either STI571 or dasatinib apoptotic cell death are PKCδ-dependent. Particularly, STI571 showed less dependence to PKCδ than dasatinib. PKCδ modulation is essential and determines mastocytosis treatment effectiveness, since STI571 and dasatinib effects are PKCδ-dependent.

This trial is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of Iclusig, administered at two starting doses, compared with nilotinib, in patients who are resistant to front-line treatment with imatinib.

                    "1): 71a, abstracts), as well as from patients with ALL ( ). This number will probably increase with time as technology for detection improves and the scope of the search widens. Usually, a single point mutation is detected but occasional patients carry more than one BCR-ABL point mutation. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that mutations outside the kinase domain can also result in molecular conformations of BCR-ABL that impair imatinib binding. Therefore, screening for mutations outside the kinase domain may be necessary in the future to fully account for imatinib resistance in patients. It is also important to note that in certain instances BCR-ABL point mutations may accompany, but cannot explain resistance to imatinib. Genetic polymorphism in genes other than BCR-ABL may also be associated with responses to imatinib. A subset of patients in the IRIS study was analyzed for polymorphic loci in 26 different genes. A correlation was observed between cytogenetic responses and a particular polymorph of a yet-to-be characterized gene, suggesting that this genotype may have predictive value with respect to imatinib responsiveness in CML The goals of CML therapy and the methods used to monitor response can influence clinical management decisions. The following recommendations to avoid or combat imatinib resistance are based on evidence obtained with imatinib in clinical trials combined with laboratory observations on samples from imatinib-treated patients and preclinical studies. Several mechanisms of imatinib resistance may operate within an individual and these may interact with each other. Therefore, some of these recommendations may necessitate concomitant application. Strategies to prevent resistance Optimal dosing at diagnosis Clinical evidence : Administration of full therapeutic doses of imatinib as early as possible is likely to promote maximal depletion of leukemic cells. Data from trials show that early use of imatinib for CML results in rapidly achieved, robust response rates with an encouraging duration. Cytogenetic responses and survival rates are higher with first-line imatinib in early, rather than late, CP CML after IFN therapy had failed. Anecdotal examples of resistance developing in patients who received suboptimal doses of imatinib at the outset of treatment or who did not comply with treatment have been reported. Starting with at least the approved imatinib dosage – 400 mg/day for CML in CP and 600 mg/day for advanced disease – can aid in diminishing relapse risk. In the phase 1 dose-escalating trial of imatinib for CP CML, up to 1000 mg/day was administered without the identification of a maximum-tolerated dose; the efficacy results showed a dose–response relationship. While the current standard dose of imatinib is 400 mg once daily, the safety and toxicity profile indicates that considerably higher doses are tolerable. In a trial ( n =36) investigating the efficacy of 800 mg/day imatinib in CP CML patients after failure with IFN therapy, 89% of patients achieved a CCR and 56% of patients reached MMR. This response level was improved compared with previous studies in which CP CML patients, previously treated with IFN, were given 400 mg/day imatinib. The use of 800 mg/day imatinib as first-line therapy in newly diagnosed early CP CML has also been investigated. In all, 114 patients were treated with 400 mg imatinib twice daily. A total of 90% achieved a CCR, defined as 0% Ph-positive cells. After a median follow-up of 15 months, no patient progressed to advanced disease. Significantly improved rate of CCR ( P =0.0005) and MMR ( P =0.00001) were achieved with 800 mg/day imatinib compared with historical data from patients treated with 400 mg/day. Together, these studies suggest that either in newly diagnosed CML without prior therapy or subsequent to IFN failure, imatinib dose escalation may be the optimal approach to avoid imatinib resistance. Rationale : Early diagnosis and treatment minimizes the opportunity for genetic instability inherent in CML to contribute to imatinib resistance. Phase 1 trials investigated optimal dosing and showed that 95% of patients achieved CHR with 400 mg/day imatinib, a dose that generated mean trough plasma levels of imatinib of 1.46 μ M . This concentration is consistent with preclinical studies demonstrating that the IC 50 of BCR-ABL kinase activity inhibition is in the micromolar range. Therefore, doses of imatinib less than 300 mg may lead to plasma imatinib concentrations that suboptimally inhibit BCR-ABL kinase activity, favoring the selection of spontaneously arising resistant clones. Strategies to treat resistant patients Dose escalation Clinical evidence : To investigate whether imatinib-resistant patients benefit from escalated dosing, 54 CML patients in CP, resistant or refractory to imatinib, were given 300 or 400 mg/day imatinib doses escalated from once to twice daily. CHRs were obtained in 65% of patients treated for hematologic resistance. Of patients treated for cytogenetic resistance, 56% achieved CCR, demonstrating that CP CML patients resistant to imatinib can be brought into response by increasing the imatinib dosage. Previously mentioned phase 2 trials of imatinib demonstrated efficacy and feasibility of increased dosing in advanced phases of CML. The 2-year follow-up data of AP patients taking 400 mg/day indicate that 87% failed to reach CCR and 82% failed to reach MCR, whereas among the group taking 600 mg/day, 76% failed to achieve CCR and 67% failed to reach MCR (Talpaz et al. Blood 2003; 102 (Supp. 1): 905a, abstract). After 24 months, the estimated progression-free survival is 32 and 49% for the 400 and 600 mg/day doses of imatinib, respectively ( ). The 2-year follow-up results among patients in BC taking 400 mg/day imatinib indicate that 97% failed to reach CCR and 94% failed to reach MCR compared with the group taking 600 mg/day in which 92% failed to achieve CCR and 82% failed to reach MCR (Talpaz et al. Blood 2003; 102 (Supp. 1): 905a, abstract), supporting dose escalation to minimize resistance in advanced phases of CML ( ). Rationale : Mechanisms of imatinib resistance that have the theoretical potential to respond to increasing concentrations of imatinib have been observed in cell lines and in patients. BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations are the most frequent mechanism associated with relapse during treatment with imatinib. Approximately 60% of relapsed patients have point mutations detected in one of the three main regions of the BCR-ABL kinase domain: (i) the amino-terminal P-loop, which includes amino acids that form the nucleotide binding loop for adenosine triphosphate (ATP), (ii) the catalytic domain and intervening sequences containing amino acids that contact imatinib, as well as (iii) the carboxy-terminal activation loop, which is critical for the control of catalytic activity. Resistance is acquired by the selective expansion of clones bearing BCR-ABL point mutations less sensitive to imatinib compared with wild type. With few exceptions, the rank order of the frequency with which point mutations appear in patient samples generally correlates with the rank order of BCR-ABL imatinib insensitivity as indicated by an increase in IC 50 of imatinib inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity. Mutations have been isolated from patients who have been shown to have diminished sensitivity to imatinib but could still be inhibited by concentrations of imatinib achievable in patients. When these mutants are the dominant clone detected during resistance, imatinib dose escalation may be justified. The relationship between imatinib resistance and the appearance of point mutations in BCR-ABL is not clearly understood because some kinase domain mutations isolated from patients have near wild-type sensitivity to imatinib. This suggests that additional mechanisms of resistance may operate in these cases. For example, BCR-ABL genomic amplification and overexpression of BCR-ABL transcripts have also been reported in resistant patients. To the extent that imatinib resistance is based on increased BCR-ABL levels in these patients, they are likely to respond to escalating concentrations of imatinib. Multidrug-resistance mechanisms are potentially involved in resistance to imatinib in patients because they limit intracellular drug concentrations. Low levels of the multidrug-resistance protein MRP1 have been shown to predict imatinib responses in patients with myeloid BC CML. Overexpression of P-glycoprotein (PGP), a MDR1 gene product that functions as a drug efflux pump, has also been suggested to play a role in imatinib resistance. Another mechanism of pharmacological interaction that may influence imatinib responses is the plasma levels of α 1 acid glycoprotein (AGP), which binds imatinib and sequesters it from cells. The addition of erythromycin, a competitor for AGP binding, restored the ability of imatinib to inhibit BCR-ABL phosphorylation in samples derived from relapsed patients. Therefore, the use of imatinib plasma levels to estimate intracellular imatinib concentrations is under debate. Other studies have shown that AGP levels can be used to predict disease progression. While AGP levels might have some prognostic value, reducing the protein-bound fraction of imatinib in patients has yet to be shown to recover responses to imatinib therapy. It is conceivable, however, that increasing imatinib concentrations can assist in overcoming resistance attributable to elevated serum AGP. Differential compartmentation of imatinib in the body can also result, for example, in subtherapeutic concentrations of imatinib in the central nervous system (CNS) owing to the blood–brain barrier. This can lead to CNS BC in CML patients otherwise experiencing cytogenetic remission. Treatment options are limited in these cases, but dose escalation of imatinib should be considered. Interruption or cessation of imatinib therapy Clinical evidence : Complete cessation or temporary interruption of imatinib therapy can be considered in certain instances of resistance. Discontinuation of imatinib therapy was found to significantly reduce a clone of cells bearing a BCR-ABL Y253H (P-loop) mutation in a resistant patient. Further, a patient taking imatinib in CP progressed to BC and subsequent withdrawal of imatinib resulted in a spontaneous reversion to CP. Rationale : Cessation or interruption of imatinib is most likely to be beneficial where relapse can be attributed to the expansion of an imatinib-resistant clone owing to a BCR-ABL point mutation that severely impairs imatinib binding. Owing to the high frequency of binding impairing mutations such as E255K or Y253F and the poor prognosis portended by P-loop mutations (Kreil et al. Blood 2003; 102 (Suppl. 1): 71a; Branford et al. Blood 2003; 101 (Suppl. 1): 71a, abstracts), it is conceivable that cessation or interruption of imatinib will become an important tool for clinical management of resistant patients. This approach relies on the reappearance of nonmutant BCR-ABL leukemic clones to suppress the mutant clone by removing its competitive advantage. Y253 was predicted to be an important point of interaction between BCR-ABL and imatinib based on crystal structure analyses of imatinib bound to ABL. Mutation T315I, which is frequently observed in resistant patients, is located in a predicted imatinib-binding site and not in the ATP-binding domain. This mutation has also been shown to confer complete insensitivity to imatinib as well as diminished intrinsic kinase activity owing to a decreased affinity to ATP. Upfront combination therapy Clinical evidence : Combination therapy is a third option to consider in combating imatinib resistance. Upfront combination therapy with cytotoxic agents, IFN or other signal transduction inhibitors has been investigated in several clinical trials. ( ) Studies (eg the CML Study IV of the German CML Study Group or the STI571 Prospective International Randomized Trial – SPIRIT) are currently underway to compare directly imatinib monotherapy vs imatinib plus cytarabine vs imatinib plus IFN as first-line therapy in thousands of randomized newly diagnosed BCR-ABL-positive CML patients. Second-line combination therapy Clinical evidence : While clinical data for second-line combination therapy are limited, this approach must be considered after imatinib monotherapy fails, despite imatinib dose escalation, to achieve MCR after 6 months, CCR after 12 months, a 3-log reduction after 18 months or relapse ensues ( ). In a significant proportion of patients lack of CR is associated with the development of cytopenias, which occurs frequently (15–40% of CP patients) during imatinib therapy. Combination therapy with imatinib plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor resulted in MCR in seven of 11 CP or AP patients, who had failed to achieve CR after 6 months of imatinib monotherapy. A recent novel approach to combination therapy involves stimulating the host immune response. In a phase 2 trial, 14 patients with CP CML were vaccinated with a BCR-ABL fusion peptide to stimulate T-cell-mediated immune responses. Four patients, also treated with IFN or imatinib, in hematologic remission had a further CR, suggesting that a peptide-derived vaccine that elicits specific immune responses can be used as combination therapy. Rationale : Combination therapy with imatinib and other agents best targets BCR-ABL-independent resistance including disease progression arising from clonal evolution or activating mutations in genes encoding molecules downstream of BCR-ABL. In addition, combination therapy may address BCR-ABL-dependent refractoriness or relapse arising from BCR-ABL point mutations or atypical BCR-ABL fusion genes that abrogate sensitivity to imatinib. Disease progression in CML is associated with nonrandom, consistently observed, karyotypic abnormalities referred to as clonal evolution. In all, 60–80% of CML patients who progress exhibit secondary chromosomal abnormalities in addition to the Ph chromosome. Clonal evolution has been demonstrated to occur during imatinib therapy and to be associated with advanced disease. Recent reports indicate that chromosomal abnormalities are also emerging in Ph-negative cells in CML patients on imatinib therapy. The underlying mechanism for the appearance of these clones during imatinib treatment is not completely understood. Imatinib may reveal the presence of pre-existing chromosomally abnormal cells. The emergence of cytogenetically unrelated Ph-negative clones with additional aberrations in CML may support the multistep model of leukemic transformation and the concept of genetic instability inherent in CML. Alternatively, these cells could arise as a consequence of the hematopoietic proliferative pressure applied to normal cells under conditions where Ph-positive cells are eradicated. That the same chromosomal abnormalities in Ph-negative cells have emerged with treatments for CML other than imatinib in patients with cytogenetic responses suggest that it is unlikely that imatinib is responsible for the initial presence of these chromosomal abnormalities. Most patients developing chromosomal abnormalities in Ph-negative cells were not found to progress until now. Whether proliferation of these abnormal Ph-negative clones contributes to relapse or the development of other clonal hematologic disorders, like myelodysplastic syndromes, during imatinib therapy will require further investigation. Preclinical evidence supporting combination therapy Conventional chemotherapeutic agents : Prior to imatinib, CML treatment was frustrated in part by the antiapoptotic effects of BCR-ABL, which renders leukemic cells resistant to chemotherapy. Imatinib chemosensitizes cells in vitro to cytotoxic agents by virtue of its ability to promote apoptosis. Several studies in Ph-positive cell lines have indicated that the cell killing effect of chemotherapeutic agents is additive or synergistic with that of imatinib. Signal transduction inhibitors : Preclinical studies have demonstrated that inhibition of downstream signaling targets of BCR-ABL such as the Ras pathway using farnesyltransferase inhibitors may be a promising combination therapy with imatinib. Other molecules that might serve as targets for inhibition of BCR-ABL downstream signaling include Jak2, MEK, and PI-3 kinases. Chaperone inhibition : BCR-ABL depends on the molecular chaperone, heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90), to attain its functional conformation. Treatment of leukemic cells, isolated from CML patients and resistant to imatinib by virtue of kinase domain point mutations, with geldanamycin, an Hsp60 inhibitor, has been shown to degrade wild-type and mutant BCR-ABL and to inhibit cell growth. Stem cell transplantation Allogeneic SCT remains the only proven cure for CML, but is limited by donor availability and treatment-related morbidity and mortality. In biologically young patients with histocompatible donors, SCT is a viable option to consider as first-line therapy, after suboptimal response to imatinib, or in cases of intractable imatinib resistance. Treatment of minimal residual disease The criterion for complete molecular remission, undetectable BCR-ABL-positive leukemic cells, is associated with continued remission. In the IRIS study, less than 5% of patients taking imatinib had undetectable BCR-ABL, indicating that this standard is rarely attained with imatinib therapy. Current limits of PCR sensitivity imply that even with a complete molecular response, a body load of 10 6 leukemic cells potentially remains. The persistence of leukemic cells after imatinib therapy raises questions as to whether and how to treat minimal residual disease. Analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from CP CML patients has demonstrated the existence of primitive quiescent Ph-positive stem cells (CD34+) that have been postulated to contribute to residual disease because their proliferation can be induced by exposure to growth factors. BCR-ABL-positive hematopoietic progenitor cells persist in CML patients with CCR to imatinib. The sensitivity of Ph- and CD34-positive stem cells to imatinib has been explored by treating stem cells, isolated from CP CML patients, with growth factors and imatinib. Imatinib appeared to have only an antiproliferative effect on the quiescent cell subpopulation, suggesting that cell-cycle-arrested stem cells are resistant to the cytocidal activity of imatinib. Another study, however, found no correlation between the proliferative status of BCR-ABL-positive cell lines and imatinib-induced apoptosis. A plausible explanation for these results is that a molecular mechanism rather than quiescence is responsible for imatinib insensitivity in stem cells. BCR-ABL mutants have been detected in CML and ALL patients prior to exposure to imatinib. The significance of these mutations, despite their low prevalence, was underscored by the observation that these patients eventually relapsed and that these mutations were the same as those previously isolated from relapsing patients. Treatment of minimal residual disease should consist mainly of continued inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity with imatinib combined with molecular surveillance. Future trials will determine the duration of treatment with imatinib necessary to sustain molecular response. Combination therapy may prove to be important in addressing the transition from minimal residual disease to resistance and eventual relapse. Trials are underway to evaluate combination therapies with imatinib and chemotherapeutic agents as first-line therapy. Whether resistance and relapse rates are reduced with combination therapy as a consequence of reducing minimal residual disease compared with imatinib monotherapy is currently an open issue. Molecularly targeted therapy with imatinib has improved treatment of CML, particularly CP patients. Emergence of resistance and relapse indicates that adaptation nevertheless plays a role in the complex interaction between imatinib and the CML disease process. Accumulating experience has provided insight into the underlying mechanisms of, and risk factors for, imatinib resistance. These have guided recommendations for the management of patients in all phases of CML treated with imatinib ( ). The outlook for long-term treatments is likely to involve combination therapies with cytotoxic agents or agents that target multiple sites along the BCR-ABL signal transduction pathway. The oncogenicity of BCR-ABL will likely mandate that inhibition of its kinase activity remains as the cornerstone of treatment for CML. Improvements"

BCR-ABL–induced ROS accumulation results in inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases ( 60 , 101 ), presumably leading to increased cell proliferation. These findings suggest that putative ROS-induced inhibition of phosphatases may contribute to leukemogenesis. In addition, ROS accumulation has been implicated in the mutagenesis of BCR-ABL oncoprotein, a mechanism through which BCR-ABL induces repression of the activity of imatinib tyrosine kinase inhibitor and therefore provides resistance to leukemia treatment ( 63 ). ROS may also be involved in the cytotoxic effect of adaphostin, another molecule targeting BCR-ABL ( 18 ).

                    "This approach complements and extends previously reported drug screens in search for hepcidin regulators, 39 , 40 in that it starts with a ‘pre-selected’ set of drugs based on a comprehensive RNAi approach, applies time-and dose-response experiments, and involves validations in primary cells and mice. With this approach we identified four compounds that modulate hepcidin mRNA levels in primary hepatocyte models ( Figure 2 ). Two of these, imatinib and spironolactone, further affected hepcidin levels in mice, causing a mild increase of transferrin saturation, without causing hepatotoxicity ( Figure 4 ). Whether these relatively modest alterations of iron parameters affect tissue iron content during long-term therapy in patients requires further investigation. Assessment of the potential for drug re-positioning The safety profile of imatinib excludes this compound from the possibility for drug re-positioning. Imatinib may cause peripheral edema, nausea, vomiting, rash, fatigue and abdominal pain. 41 , 42 In addition, patients on imatinib may develop congestive heart failure due to severe left ventricular dysfunction. 41 By comparison, spironolactone shows relatively minor adverse effects. It was approved in 1959 and initially was used as supplementary therapy for refractory hypertension. 37 Although it is well-tolerated, antiandrogenic effects of spironolactone were reported, mainly due to cross-reactivity",
                    "which hepcidin deficiency and increased iron levels were reported. 50 Further suppression of hepcidin levels by spironolactone treatment ( Figure 4A ) may cause an even more pronounced dysregulation of iron homeostasis in cirrhotic patients, which may outweigh its beneficial effects on edema and thus provide a rationale for the application of alternative agents. Mechanistic insights Our data further generate insight into the potential mode of action of imatinib and spironolactone. For them to modulate hepcidin expression, these drugs require preserved BMP signaling mediated by the BMP responsive elements located in the hepcidin promoter ( Figure 2B ). 17 Imatinib displays a much broader range of inhibitory activity than originally described. 33 Our data demonstrate that in the context of hepcidin regulation, imatinib may suppress its non-kinase target oxidoreductase NQO2, 33 which was identified as a hepcidin activator in our study ( Figure 1B ). Consistently, quercetin, another agent that suppresses NQO2, also reduces hepcidin mRNA levels ( Figure 3D ). How NQO2 regulates hepcidin remains to be established. Previous studies suggested that"

It was concluded that its clinical success may depend on a more precise selection of patients with exploitable tumor targets or in combination with other agents ( Table 2 ) [ 42 ]. In 2006, Curtin JA et al. reported KIT as an important oncogene in melanoma and proposed that imatinib can be beneficial in this significant group of patient [ 43 ]. Consequently, several in vitro studies focused on assessment of imatinib in c-KIt mutant melanoma and reported significant sensitivities ( Table 1 ) [ 44 ]. Coherently, the NCT00470470 clinical trial showed significant clinical responses of imatinib in a subset of patients harboring KIT alterations with overall response rate of 16% (95% CI, 2–30%) ( Table 2 ) [ 31 ]. In parallel, a phase II trial with imatinib in China demonstrated overall response rate to imatinib of 30.2% (95% CI, 16–44.4) ( Table 2 ) [ 45 ]. In accordance, the NCT00424515 trial indicated that imatinib was effective only in tumors harboring KIT mutations, and not KIT amplification and one of the mechanisms of resistance to imatinib could be associated to NRAS mutations or KIT copy number gain ( Table 2 ) [ 32 ]. Furthermore, a diversity of KIT mutations was shown in melanoma, some were sensitive to imatinib, while others were either imatinib-resistant or not studied yet. Particularly, it was reported that melanoma non-responders harbor specific c-KIT mutations known to confer imatinib resistance in GIST, such as D820Y, N822K, and A829P, while responders show mutation on exon 11 or exon 13 [ 31 , 32 ]. In 2014, a case report expanded the melanoma population that could benefit from imatinib to those with somatic exon 8 KIT mutations [ 46 ].

Drug preparation Imatinib pills were dissolved in water and filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter and brought to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml (100 μl doses). Nilotinib (Tasigna, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) was dissolved in 10% NMP/90% PEG-300 and administered once daily at a dose of 100 mg/kg by oral gavage. The Cy/G protocol for HSC mobilization has been previously described. 38 Briefly, during imatinib therapy, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 4 mg cyclophosphamide (Cy;Bristol-Myers Squibb). G-CSF was then administered for 4 consecutive days by subcutaneous injection (5 μg/mouse; 100 μl of a 5 μg/100 μl solution; ∼ 250 μg/kg). Arsenic trioxide was administered with daily intraperitoneal injections for 14 consecutive days (10 μg in 100 μl per 20 g mouse). Imatinib (Gleevec), Cy (Cytoxan), G-CSF (Neupogen) and arsenic (Trisenox) were purchased or graciously donated to the laboratory from the hospital pharmacy.

PDGFR has been shown to be a potent mitogen for myofibroblast formation, a signature of fibrotic conditions and implicated in the progression of fibrosis (Bonner, J. et al., 1998, American Journal Physiology 274 (1Pt1): L72-L80). In addition, blockade of PDGF signaling has been demonstrated to reduce the development of fibrosis in various experimental models (Yoshiji, et al., 2006, Int. J. Mol. Med. 17:899-904). Imatinib, for example, a known inhibitor of PDGF signaling, has demonstrated anti-fibrotic activity in several animal models of fibrosis (Akhmetshina, A., et al., 2009, Arthritis Rheumatism 60(1): 219-224; Vuorinen, K., et al., 2007, Experimental Lung Research 33(7): 357-373; Aono, Y., et al., 2005, American Journal Respiratory Critical Care Medicine 171(11): 1279-1285). There are multiple case reports of patients with fibrotic conditions benefiting from treatment with Imatinib (Kay, J., et al., 2008, Arthritis Rheumatism 58(8): 2543-2548; Distler J., et al., 2008, Arthritis Rheumatism 58(8): 2538-2542; Hirose, Y., et al., 2002 International Journal Hematology 76(4): 349-353). Imatinib recently completed a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II study in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), a tyrosine receptor kinase also known as cFMS, is the receptor for colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), also known as M-CSF.

Despite the remarkable results achieved with imatinib, the emergence of resistance to this drug has become a significant problem. Several strategies have been developed to overcome imatinib resistance, including dose escalation of the drug, combination treatments or novel targeted agents. Nilotinib is a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor 30-50 fold more potent than imatinib with high affinity and selectivity on BCR/ABL, active against a wide range of mutant clones, except T315I mutation. Phase II trials of nilotinib showed high activity in imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML patients; front-line treatment of chronic phase Ph+ CML demonstrated rapid and stable cytogenetic responses and increasing molecular responses.

Additional ponatinib targets were shown to be the SRC kinases and a number of receptor tyrosine kinases (KIT, RET, PDGFR, VEGF receptor, DDR, EPH, TRK, and FGFR family members), indicating mediumrange specificity (i.e., less specific than imatinib/nilotinib but more specific than dasatinib/bosutinib). An ethinyl linkage (C-C triple bond) in ponatinib allows binding of the compound to the kinase domain despite the presence of the bulky isoleucine residue in the T315I gatekeeper mutation, which blocks the binding of imatinib and second-generation Bcr–Abl TKIs. Many other binding features of ponatinib are remarkably similar to those observed for nilotinib, such as the methylphenyl and the trifluormethylphenyl rings that occupy almost identical positions when bound to the Abl kinase domain ( Fig. 1C ; ref. 28 ).

The best documented case of targeted therapy in cancer molecular biology is that of the Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which target the kinase domain of the BCR-ABL protein, which is responsible for the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) through the enhancement of the proliferation and viability of myeloid cell lineage ( Evans et al., 1993 ). Imatinib mersylate targets the kinase domain of BCR-ABL ( Druker et al., 1996 ; Sawyers et al., 2002 ), and was designed to bind to the active site of the protein and block its biological activity. This approach revolutionized the treatment of CML, although new difficulties arose. The main drawback in target therapy is the mutation of the target, and in this specific case, the mutation of the imatinib binding site, which makes 20–40% of patients resistant to imatinib therapy ( Shah et al., 2002 ; Azam et al., 2008 ). As the use of imatinib grew, case reports on imatinib resistant CML began to appear, indicating that the majority of resistant phenotypes are associated with point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain ( Roumiantsev et al., 2002 ). The exact effects of mutations on the therapeutic efficiency of the TKIs are determined by the type of mutation (missense or silent) and their position in the target molecule (active site, P-loop). A number of studies have identified critical point mutations in the kinase domain of the BCR-ABL protein ( Elias et al., 2014 ). These mutations reduce the affinity of the imatinib with its target, and may be accompanied by the amplification of the BCR-ABL gene ( Gorre et al., 2001 ). Due to the clinical impact of the failure of imatinib therapy, the mutations were identified, and a second generation of the drug was developed to target these mutations ( Weisberg et al., 2005 ). This resulted in the development of Nilotinib, Dasatinib and Bosutinib, which improved the response in the patients, but once again, novel mutations arose, and recently, a"

Similarly, combination of ABC294640 with sorafenib caused synergistic apoptosis of cholangiocarcinoma cells, and this was associated with marked suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation ( Ding et al., 2016 ). Combination of ABC294640 with the microtubule stabilizer paclitaxel was shown to greatly increase caspase-9 signaling and apoptosis when compared with either drug alone ( White, Chan, Antoon, \u0026 Beckman, 2013 ). ABC294640 has also been combined with doxorubicin, vincristine, imatinib, and bortezomib in ALL cells ( Wallington-Beddoe et al., 2014 ). Only additive effects were observed with the DNA intercalating agent doxorubicin and the mitosis inhibitor vincristine. However, synergistic cell death was produced with the protea-some inhibitor bortezomib and the multityrosine kinase inhibitor (i.e., Bcr-Abl inhibitor) imatinib when either was combined with ABC294640 ( Wallington-Beddoe et al., 2014 ). ABC294640 treatment of cervical carcinoma cells promoted apoptosis that was amplified by combination with the BCL-2 inhibitor GDC-0199 both in vitro and in vivo ( Xu et al., 2018 ). 3.2.

Plasmid DNA Constructs (pcDNA 3.2 V5 DEST Expression Vector) D816V KIT D820A KIT VV559-560 deletion/D816V KIT GIST most often become Gleevec® (imatinib) resistant, and molecularly targeted small molecule therapies that target c-KIT secondary mutations remain elusive. GIST patients who relapse after treatment with Gleevec® (imatinib) or Sutent® (sunitinib) have disease still driven by c-KIT mutations. These secondary mutations occur on the same alleles as the primary JM-region mutation, and thus represent even more aggressive activated forms of c-KIT than the original primary mutation. The CHO K1 cellular assays described above demonstrate that certain compounds of the present invention inhibit many mutant forms of cKIT kinase that have been detected in GIST patients that have acquired resistance to imatinib or sunitinib treatment (Table 3).

Results Imatinib and Se cytotoxic activities in human CRC cells are concentration and time dependent To elucidate the cytotoxic activities of imatinib and Se, we treated HCT116 cells with imatinib. The IC 50 (s) of imatinib were 37.5, 34.3 and 21.2 μM after 24, 48 and 72 hr, respectively (fig. 1 A). Although Se responses on HCT116 cells were marginal at 24 and 48 hr of exposure, 42.2 μM Se was able to induce growth inhibition (50%) after 72 hr of incubation (fig. 1 B). Cross‐matching combination revealed that the most pronounced and concentration‐effective cytotoxicity resulted from simultaneous combination of imatinib with 2 and 4 μM Se (fig. 1 C). As shown in fig. 1 D,E, combining a fixed dose of 2 μM Se with different concentrations of imatinib resulted in more cytotoxic effect compared to that of 4 μM Se after 48 and 72 hr, respectively. Se synergizes imatinib cytotoxicity in HCT116 cells To evaluate the interaction type between imatinib and Se, isobologram analysis was performed. Isobologram analysis supported by phase‐contrast images revealed that simultaneous exposure to imatinib and Se showed synergism (fig. 2 A,B). Synergism corresponding to CI 1) for both drugs (tables 1 and 2 ). Accordingly, for subsequent mechanistic studies, 2 μM Se with 10 μM imatinib combination regimen was chosen because of its lower CI.

Moreover, their simultaneous combination significantly increased caspase 3 activity by 1.73‐, 1.5‐ and 1.13‐fold as compared to the control, imatinib and Se when used alone, respectively. In addition, activation of apoptotic machinery in the combination‐treated cells was associated with decreased Bcl‐2 expression (fig. 3 B) and increased extent of DNA laddering compared to that of imatinib and Se when used alone (fig. 3 C). Se modulates imatinib cytotoxicity via inhibition of Beclin1‐dependent autophagy Autophagy could be detected using the lysomotropic agent, acridine orange. This dye accumulates in AVO; when excited with blue light, it shows green fluorescence in cytoplasm and nucleus and red fluorescence in the acidic vesicular (lysosomal) compartments 13 . In the present study, imatinib slightly increased Beclin‐1 expression and AVOs formation compared to the control cells (fig. 4 A). On the other hand, Se markedly decreased Beclin‐1 mRNA level and AVOs formation compared to the control and imatinib‐treated cells. Furthermore, imatinib and Se combination led to further inhibition of autophagy in HCT116 cells via down‐regulation of Beclin‐1 transcription and AVOs formation compared to imatinib‐ and vehicle‐treated cells (fig. 4 B). Se synergizes imatinib cytotoxicity via induction of S‐phase arrest To explore whether imatinib, Se and their combination exert their growth inhibitory effects via cell cycle arrest, we determined the cell cycle distribution of the treated cells, compared to the vehicle‐treated cells. After 72 hr of treatment, 10 μM imatinib significantly caused G 0 /G 1 phase arrest and depletion of the cell population in G 2 /M phase (fig. 5 ). Similarly, 2 μM Se when used alone significantly led to G 0 /G 1 phase arrest and reduction of the cell population in G 2 /M phase. Surprisingly, it has been found that imatinib and Se co‐treatment was associated with prominent S‐phase arrest where cells were shifted to S phase on the expense of both G 0 /G 1 and G 2 /M phases (table 3 ).

Drug eluting stent (DES), a novel stent coated with a cell-growth inhibitor, such as rapamycin, has been utilized to block SMC proliferation, but DES also blocks EC repair and thus requires the administration of anti-platelets for a long time to prevent thrombus formation after PCI. Moreover, insufficient prevention of platelet aggregation sometimes induces restenosis after PCI. One of the signal transduction inhibitors, imatinib mesilate, blocks tyrosine kinase activity of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and therefore it may block the development of neointima through growth inhibition of SMCs without the obstructive effect on EC-repair. We therefore studied the effects of imatinib on neointimal hyperplasia in a balloon injury model of rat carotid arteries. Rats were orally administered with imatinib for 14 days after balloon injury, and sacrificed to analyze the neointimal formation. Intimal hyperplasia was inhibited by imatinib in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore imatinib presumably obstructed the growth of SMCs via interception on growth-signaling of PDGFR. The administration of imatinib after coronary stenting or the use of an imatinib-eluting stent may further reduce the risk of restenosis in patients. \n                               \n                            "

The results showed that overexpression of WT Zap70, other than KD Zap70 or Y319F Zap70, could increase the CSF‐1 gene transcription (Fig. 5 A). The increased CSF‐1 gene transcriptional activity was reduced if the WT Zap70‐transfected cells were preincubated with STI571 or piceatannol before stimulation with L‐selectin ligation (Fig. 5 B). With pretreatment of the WT c‐Abl kinase‐overexpressing cells with piceatannol or STI571 before L‐selectin ligation, the CSF‐1 gene transcriptional activation was also reduced (Fig. 5 C).

Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a fibro-inflammatory disease in which recurrent pancreatic inflammation leads to pancreatic fibrosis. In the present study, we have investigated the role of DDR1 and DDR2 in CP. The induced expression of DDR1 and DDR2 was observed in primary pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and cerulein-induced CP. Subsequently, the protective effects of DDR1/DDR2 inhibitor, imatinib (IMT) were investigated. Pharmacological intervention with IMT effectively downregulated DDR1 and DDR2 expression. Further, IMT treatment reduced pancreatic injury, inflammation, extracellular matrix deposition and PSCs activation along with inhibition of TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of DDR1 and DDR2 controls pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis, which"

However, there are no data about the mechanism of overexpression of IGF2 in GIST. We hypothesized that this overexpression was also related to LOI. Moreover, since there is a major overlap between KIT and IGF1R downstream cascades, we hypothesized that IGF2 overexpression was associated with resistance to imatinib. We performed this study in order to address these two hypotheses. Patients and Methods Patients One hundred thirty one patients with a diagnosis of GIST, identified from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY, USA) sarcoma database, were included in this study on the basis of available material for molecular experiments. Patient characteristics are described in Table 1 . The proportion of small bowel GIST was slightly higher than that of GIST originating from the stomach. This reflects the poorer prognosis of small bowel GIST patients which are more likely to relapse and to receive imatinib. Pediatric and young adult cases were defined by an age at diagnosis of ≤18 years and \u003e18 but ≤30 years, respectively. In all cases, the pathologic diagnosis was confirmed using standard H\u0026E staining and immunoreactivity for CD117 (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, California; 1:500) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. KIT (exons 9, 11, 13, 14, and 17) and PDGFRA (exon 12, 14, 18) genotyping was performed as previously described ( 24 ). Response to imatinib was assessed according to CHOI criteria ( 25 ). “Responsive” samples were obtained by surgical resection of the tumor before any radiological progression of the disease with imatinib treatment. “Resistant” samples were obtained by surgical resection of a lesion with evidence of radiological progression under imatinib treatment. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB-protocol 02-060).

Bar represents median, * P \u003c 0.05 using Student’s t test unless otherwise indicated. Discussion Agonistic CD40 therapy further inhibited tumor growth in Kit V558Δ/+ GIST-bearing mice when combined with imatinib, and the mechanism depended largely on macrophages and less on CD8 + T cells. Previously, we reported that TAMs in Kit V558Δ/+ tumors and human GISTs are M1-like at baseline, as they expressed activation markers, stimulated T cells, and secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines ( 10 ). Four weeks of TAM depletion with the small molecule CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622 increased tumor weight in Kit V558Δ/+ mice. Imatinib therapy in both Kit V558Δ/+ mice and GIST patients polarized TAMs to a more M2-like phenotype. Nevertheless, TAM depletion in the setting of imatinib therapy did not further reduce tumor weight in Kit V558Δ/+ mice( 10 ). Therefore, we sought alternative approaches to manipulate TAMs for therapeutic advantage during imatinib therapy. Anti-CD40 therapy activated TAMs and recruited inflammatory monocytes into the tumor microenvironment. TAMs from Kit V558Δ/+ mice treated with anti-CD40 and imatinib produced more inflammatory cytokines and achieved greater direct tumor inhibition in vitro . Even after two weeks of treatment, the activated TAMs were more M1-like and continued to produce increased TNF and IL6 compared to TAMs from mice treated with imatinib alone. Murine GISTs increased CCL2 production after CD40 ligation, likely contributing to the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to the tumor from the bone marrow and amplification of the antitumor response. We demonstrated that TAM depletion abrogated the tumor weight and histologic effects of anti-CD40 and imatinib therapy. The effects of anti-CD40 in many other tumor models have relied on CD8 + T cells ( 16 – 18 ). In our GIST model, we found that CD8 + T cells appeared to play a partial role in the anti-CD40 and imatinib effect. Combination therapy during CD8 + T-cell depletion achieved only a small decrease in tumor weight, yet a moderate decrease in Ki67 staining and a moderate increase in collagen was observed. Thus, the predominant mechanism of combined anti-CD40 and imatinib appeared to be through TAMs. We found that treatment with anti-CD40 upregulated PD-1. Just as CD40 has been cited as a resistance mechanism to PD-1/PDL-1 blockade ( 37 , 38 ), the PD-1/PDL-1 axis has also been implicated in resistance to anti-CD40 ( 39 ). It is conceivable that anti–PD-1 therapy may ameliorate T-cell exhaustion induced by anti-CD40 and enable sustained T-cell activation in the setting of macrophage activation. The mechanism of combined CD40 ligation and imatinib, therefore, was mediated predominantly by activated intratumoral TAMs and partly by CD8 + T cells. The resulting tumor cell loss and reduction in proliferation were accompanied by a decrease in KIT signaling, which we have observed previously after extensive tumor destruction, such as after treatment with crizotinib (a MET inhibitor) and imatinib ( 27 ). Although tumor cells expressed CD40 in our mouse model and in human GIST specimens, anti-CD40 did not have a direct inhibitory effect on tumor growth in GIST T1 xenografts. It is important to recognize that although imatinib decreases tumor weight in Kit V558Δ/+ mice at one week by 50-70%, the histologic effects in the residual cells are minimal ( 31 ). In contrast, in human GISTs, imatinib induces profound histologic effects, including necrosis, decreased cellularity, and fibrosis, although the duration of treatment is much longer. However, tumor weight may not be a reliable measure of outcome for anti-CD40 and other therapies that may initially induce intratumoral inflammation and edema. Wolchok et al. established that response to immunotherapy may be better measured by immune-related response criteria compared to traditional assessment of treatment response ( 40 ), as immune cell infiltration into lesions may be inaccurately interpreted as progressive disease. Therefore, we utilized several other measurements to determine the antitumor effects of anti-CD40 and imatinib, including percentage of Kit + cells, tumor proliferation by Ki67 staining, treatment effect on H\u0026E histology, and fibrosis by Trichrome staining. We found that CD40 expression on a human GIST cell line was partially regulated by IFNγ, TNF, and TGFβ. Each of these cytokines was reduced in bulk Kit V558Δ/+ tumors by imatinib, and may be the cause of decreased tumor cell CD40 expression in Kit V558Δ/+ mice with imatinib. Although anti-CD40 monotherapy in Kit V558Δ/+ mice stimulated TAMs (assessed by the expression of activation markers, cytokine production, and in vitro tumor cell killing), no detectable antitumor effects in vivo were observed. These findings imply that either the tumor microenvironment restrains activated macrophages or tumor cells are resistant to activated TAMs. We previously demonstrated in our mouse model that immunotherapy with either PD-1 or CTLA-4 blockade is not as effective without imatinib, in part, due to tumor production of IDO, which suppresses T cells ( 9 , 11 ). It is likely that a similar immunosuppressive mechanism exists against TAMs, either through direct tumor-macrophage interaction or tumor cell factors. Imatinib reduces KIT signaling and tumor cell proliferation, which are likely needed for antitumor TAM activity in vivo , as suggested by the inability of anti-CD40 and imatinib to exert an antitumor effect in an imatinib-resistant mouse model. The dependence of immunotherapy on imatinib in GIST is an important and recurrent theme. The magnitude of the antitumor effects in Kit V558Δ/+ mice with established GISTs depended on the sequence of anti-CD40 and imatinib administration. When imatinib was started three days before anti-CD40 injection, TAMs were less activated and produced less TNF and IL6 four days later. Thus, imatinib modulated the tumor microenvironment (directly or via tumor cell inhibition) or TAMs to dampen TAM activation by anti-CD40. Our findings are consistent with those of Byrne et al., who found in a mouse model of pancreas cancer that hepatotoxicity occurs only when anti-CD40 is given prior to chemotherapy ( 41"

Isolated imatinib-induced ascites has not been reported previously in CML patients. However, Posadas et al. have described the development of imatinib-induced, non-malignant ascites in a patient with ovarian carcinoma treated with a high dose of the drug (800 mg/day) [ 8 ]. They argued that, in such cases, ascites might be caused or augmented by imatinib and should be differentiated from malignant ascites caused by the underlying intraabdominal neoplasia. The implantation of intraperitoneal meshes for hernia repair is not associated with postoperative ascites. A mild, self-limiting foreign-body reaction is known to occur, and the use of fatty acid coating of the polypropylene mesh aims at reducing"

Van Dongen et al, Int J Cancer. 2010 Aug 15;127(4):899-909. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25113 . Anti-inflammatory M2 type macrophages characterize metastasized and tyrosine kinase inhibitor-treated gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). reports that tumors treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib and sunitinib,induced secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-10 in macrophage cultures, indicating that treatment with these inhibitors might contribute to an immune suppressive microenvironment in GIST. Overall, data revealed GIST as an active site of tumor-immune interaction in which suppressive mechanisms overrule potential antitumor responses. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors might promote this negative balance. Louvet et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2008 , Tyrosine kinase inhibitors reverse type 1 diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice,reports how tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors offer opportunities for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Treatment with imatinib (Gleevec) prevented and reversed T1D in NOD mice. Similar results were observed with sunitinib (Sutent). Another TK inhibitor, PLX647 showed only marginal efficacy whereas a soluble form of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), PDGFRbetalg, rapidly reversed diabetes. Imatinib treatment led to durable remission and long-term efficacy and tolerance is likely to depend on inhibiting a combination of tyrosine kinases supporting the use of selective kinase inhibitors for the treatment of T1D. Agostinoet et al, J Oncol Pharm Pract . Epub 2010, Effect of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib, sorafenib, dasatinib, and imatinib) on blood glucose levels in diabetic and nondiabetic patients in general clinical practice, describes how tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) influenced the blood glucose (BG) concentrations in patients treated with dasatinib, imatinib, sorafenib, and sunitinib. All showed significant declines in BG. Although the mechanism for the hypoglycemic effect of these drugs is unclear, c-kit and PDGFRβ were common target kinases.
